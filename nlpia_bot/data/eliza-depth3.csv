0,0,ELIZA,Overview,"Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA, running the DOCTOR script, was created to provide a parody of ""the responses of a non-directional psychotherapist in an initial psychiatric interview"" and to ""demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial""."
1,0,ELIZA,Overview,"While ELIZA is most well known for acting in the manner of a psychotherapist, this mannerism is due to the data and instructions supplied by the DOCTOR script."
2,0,ELIZA,Overview,"ELIZA itself examined the text for keywords, applied values to said keywords, and transformed the input into an output; the script that ELIZA ran determined the keywords, set the values of keywords, and set the rules of transformation for the output."
3,0,ELIZA,Overview,"Weizenbaum chose to make the DOCTOR script in the context of psychotherapy to ""sidestep the problem of giving the program a data base of real-world knowledge"", as in a Rogerian therapeutic situation, the program had only to reflect back the patient's statements."
4,0,ELIZA,Overview,"The algorithms of DOCTOR allowed for a deceptively intelligent response, that deceived many individuals when first using the program."
5,0,ELIZA,Overview,"Weizenbaum named his program ELIZA after Eliza Doolittle, a working-class character in George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion."
6,0,ELIZA,Overview,"According to Weizenbaum, ELIZA's ability to be ""incrementally improved"" by various users made it similar to Eliza Doolittle, since Eliza Doolittle was taught to speak with an upper-class accent in Shaw's play."
7,0,ELIZA,Overview,"However, unlike in Shaw's play, ELIZA is incapable of learning new patterns of speech or new words through interaction alone."
8,0,ELIZA,Overview,"Edits must be made directly to ELIZA's active script in order to change the manner by which the program operates.
"
9,0,ELIZA,Overview,"Weizenbaum first implemented ELIZA in his own SLIP list-processing language, where, depending upon the initial entries by the user, the illusion of human intelligence could appear, or be dispelled through several interchanges."
10,0,ELIZA,Overview,"Some of ELIZA's responses were so convincing that Weizenbaum and several others have anecdotes of users becoming emotionally attached to the program, occasionally forgetting that they were conversing with a computer."
11,0,ELIZA,Overview,Weizenbaum's own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation.
12,0,ELIZA,Overview,Weizenbaum was surprised by this
13,0,ELIZA,Overview,", later writing, ""I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.""In 1966, interactive computing (via a teletype) was new."
14,0,ELIZA,Overview,"It was 15 years before the personal computer became familiar to the general public, and three decades before most people encountered attempts at natural language processing in Internet services like Ask.com or PC help systems such as Microsoft Office Clippit."
15,0,ELIZA,Overview,"Although those programs included years of research and work, ELIZA remains a milestone simply because it was the first time a programmer had attempted such a human-machine interaction with the goal of creating the illusion (however brief) of human-human interaction."
16,0,ELIZA,Overview,At the ICCC 1972 ELIZA met another early artificial intelligence program named PARRY and had a computer-only conversation.
17,0,ELIZA,Overview,"While ELIZA was built to be a ""Doctor"" PARRY was intended to simulate a patient with schizophrenia."
18,0,ELIZA,Design,"Weizenbaum originally wrote ELIZA in MAD-Slip for the IBM 7094, as a program to make natural language conversation possible with a computer."
19,0,ELIZA,Design,"To accomplish this, Weizenbaum identified five ""fundamental technical problems"" for ELIZA to overcome: the identification of critical words, the discovery of a minimal context, the choice of appropriate transformations, the generation of responses appropriate to the transformation or in the absence of critical words and the provision of an ending capacity for ELIZA scripts."
20,0,ELIZA,Design,Weizenbaum solved these problems in his ELIZA program and made ELIZA such that it had no built in contextual framework or universe of discourse.
21,0,ELIZA,Design,"However, this required ELIZA to have a script of instructions on how to respond to inputs from users.
"
22,0,ELIZA,Design,"ELIZA starts its process of responding to an input by a user by first examining the text input for a ""keyword""."
23,0,ELIZA,Design,"A ""keyword"" is a word designated as important by the acting ELIZA script, which assigns to each keyword a precedence number, or a RANK, designed by the programmer."
24,0,ELIZA,Design,"If such words are found, they are put into a ""keystack"", with the keyword of the highest RANK at the top."
25,0,ELIZA,Design,The input sentence is then manipulated and transformed as the rule associated with the keyword of the highest RANK directs.
26,0,ELIZA,Design,"For example, when the DOCTOR script encounters words such as ""alike"" or ""same"", it would output a message pertaining to similarity, in this case “"
27,0,ELIZA,Design,"In what way?”, as these words had high precedence number."
28,0,ELIZA,Design,"This also demonstrates how certain words, as dictated by the script, can be manipulated regardless of contextual considerations, such as switching first-person pronouns and second-person pronouns and vice versa, as these too had high precedence numbers."
29,0,ELIZA,Design,"Such words with high precedence numbers are deemed superior to conversational patterns, and are treated independently of contextual patterns.
"
30,0,ELIZA,Design,"Following the first examination, the next step of the process is to apply an appropriate transformation rule, which includes two parts, the ""decomposition rule"" and the ""reassembly rule""."
31,0,ELIZA,Design,"First, the input is reviewed for syntactical patterns in order to establish the minimal context necessary to respond."
32,0,ELIZA,Design,"Using the keywords and other nearby words from the input, different disassembly rules are tested until an appropriate pattern is found."
33,0,ELIZA,Design,"Using the script's rules, the sentence is then ""dismantled"" and arranged into sections of the component parts as the ""decomposition rule for the highest ranking keyword"" dictates."
34,0,ELIZA,Design,"The example that Weizenbaum gives is the input ""I are very helpful"" (remembering that ""I"" is ""You"" transformed), which is broken into (1) empty (2) I (3) are (4) very helpful."
35,0,ELIZA,Design,"The decomposition rule has broken the phrase into four small segments, that contain both the keywords and the information in the sentence."
36,0,ELIZA,Design,"The decomposition rule then designates a particular reassembly rule, or set of reassembly rules, to follow when reconstructing the sentence."
37,0,ELIZA,Design,"The reassembly rule then takes the fragments of the input that the decomposition rule had created, rearranges them, and adds in programmed words to create a response."
38,0,ELIZA,Design,"Using Weizenbaum's example previously stated, such a reassembly rule would take the fragments and apply them to the phrase ""What makes you think I am (4)"" which would result in ""What makes you think I am very helpful""."
39,0,ELIZA,Design,"This example is rather simple, since depending upon the disassembly rule, the output could be significantly more complex and use more of the input from the user."
40,0,ELIZA,Design,"However, from this reassembly, ELIZA then sends the constructed sentence to the user in the form of text on the screen."
41,0,ELIZA,Design,"These steps represent the bulk of the procedures which ELIZA follows in order to create a response from a typical input, though there are several specialized situations that ELIZA/DOCTOR can respond to."
42,0,ELIZA,Design,One Weizenbaum specifically wrote about was when there is not a keyword.
43,0,ELIZA,Design,"One solution was to have ELIZA respond with a remark that lacked content, such as ""I see"" or ""Please go on""."
44,0,ELIZA,Design,"The second method was to use a ""MEMORY"" structure, which recorded prior recent inputs, and would use these inputs to create a response referencing a part of the earlier conversation when encountered with no keywords."
45,0,ELIZA,Design,"This was possible due to Slip's ability to tag words for other usage, which simultaneously allowed ELIZA to examine, store and repurpose words for usage in outputs."
46,0,ELIZA,Design,"While these functions were all framed in ELIZA's programming, the exact manner by which the program dismantled, examined, and reassembled inputs is determined by the operating script."
47,0,ELIZA,Design,"However, the script is not static, and can be edited, or a new one created, as is necessary for the operation in the context needed (thus how ELIZA can ""learn"" new information)."
48,0,ELIZA,Design,"This would allow the program to be applied in multiple situations, including the well-known DOCTOR script, which simulates a Rogerian psychotherapist.
"
49,0,ELIZA,Design,Weizenbaum's original MAD-SLIP implementation was re-written in Lisp by Bernie Cosell.
50,0,ELIZA,Design,A BASIC version appeared in Creative Computing in 1977 (although it was written in 1973 by Jeff Shrager).
51,0,ELIZA,Design,"This version, which was ported to many of the earliest personal computers, appears to have been subsequently translated into many other versions in many other languages.
"
52,0,ELIZA,Design,"Another version of Eliza popular among software engineers is the version that comes with the default release of GNU Emacs, and which can be accessed by typing M-x doctor from most modern emacs implementations."
53,0,ELIZA,In popular culture,"In 1969, George Lucas and Walter Murch incorporated an Eliza-like dialogue interface in their screenplay for the feature film THX-1138."

83,1,ELIZA effect,Overview,"In its specific form, the ELIZA effect refers only to ""the susceptibility of people to read far more understanding than is warranted into strings of symbols—especially words"
84,1,ELIZA effect,Overview,"—strung together by computers""."
85,1,ELIZA effect,Overview,"A trivial example of the specific form of the Eliza effect, given by Douglas Hofstadter, involves an automated teller machine which displays the words ""THANK YOU"" at the end of a transaction."
86,1,ELIZA effect,Overview,"A (very) casual observer might think that the machine is actually expressing gratitude; however, the machine is only printing a preprogrammed string of symbols."
87,1,ELIZA effect,Overview,"More generally, the ELIZA effect describes any situation where, based solely on a system's output, users perceive computer systems as having ""intrinsic qualities and abilities which the software controlling the (output) cannot possibly achieve"" or ""assume that [outputs] reflect a greater causality than they actually do""."
88,1,ELIZA effect,Overview,"In both its specific and general forms, the ELIZA effect is notable for occurring even when users of the system are aware of the determinate nature of output produced by the system."
89,1,ELIZA effect,Overview,"From a psychological standpoint, the ELIZA effect is the result of a subtle cognitive dissonance between the user's awareness of programming limitations and their behavior towards the output of the program."
90,1,ELIZA effect,Overview,"The discovery of the ELIZA effect was an important development in artificial intelligence, demonstrating the principle of using social engineering rather than explicit programming to pass a Turing test."
91,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"The effect is named for the 1966 chatterbot ELIZA, developed by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum."
92,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"When executing Weizenbaum's DOCTOR script, ELIZA parodied a Rogerian psychotherapist, largely by rephrasing the ""patient""'s replies as questions:

Human:"
93,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"Well, my boyfriend made me come here.
"
94,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,ELIZA:
95,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"Your boyfriend made you come here?
"

"
98,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"ELIZA: I am sorry to hear you are depressed.
"
99,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,Human: It's true.
100,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"I'm unhappy.
"
101,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,ELIZA:
102,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy?Though designed strictly as a mechanism to support ""natural language conversation"" with a computer, ELIZA's DOCTOR script was found to be surprisingly successful in eliciting emotional responses from users who, in the course of interacting with the program, began to ascribe understanding and motivation to the program's output."
103,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"As Weizenbaum later wrote, ""I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people."
104,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"Indeed, ELIZA's code had not been designed to evoke this reaction in the first place."
105,1,ELIZA effect,Origin,"Upon observation, researchers discovered users unconsciously assuming ELIZA's questions implied interest and emotional involvement in the topics discussed, even when they consciously knew that ELIZA did not simulate emotion."
106,2,Philosophical zombie,History,"Philosophical zombies are associated with David Chalmers, but it was philosopher Robert Kirk who first used the term ""zombie"" in this context in 1974."
107,2,Philosophical zombie,History,"Prior to that, Karlyn Campbell made a similar argument in his 1970 book Body and Mind, using the term ""Imitation Man."
108,2,Philosophical zombie,History,"Chalmers further developed and popularized the idea in his work.
"
109,2,Philosophical zombie,History,There has been a lively debate about what the zombie argument shows.
110,2,Philosophical zombie,History,"Critics who primarily argue that zombies are not conceivable include Daniel Dennett, Nigil J. T. Thomas, David Braddon-Mitchell, and Robert Kirk; critics who assert mostly that conceivability does not entail possibility include Katalin Balog, Keith Frankish, Christopher Hill, and Stephen Yablo; and critics who question the logical validity of the argument include George Bealer."
111,2,Philosophical zombie,History,"In his 2019 update to the article on philosophical zombies in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Kirk summed up the current state of the debate:

"
112,2,Philosophical zombie,History,In spite of the fact that the arguments on both sides have become increasingly sophisticated — or perhaps because of it
113,2,Philosophical zombie,History,— they have not become more persuasive.
114,2,Philosophical zombie,History,"The pull in each direction remains strong.
"
115,2,Philosophical zombie,History,"A 2013 survey of professional philosophers conducted by Bourget and Chalmers produced the following results:

35.6% said P Zombies were conceivable but not metaphysically possible; 23.3% said they were metaphysically possible; 16.0% said they were inconceivable; and 25.1% responded ""other."
116,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"Though philosophical zombies are widely used in thought experiments, the detailed articulation of the concept is not always the same."
117,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"P-zombies were introduced primarily to argue against specific types of physicalism such as behaviorism, according to which mental states exist solely as behavior."
118,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"Belief, desire, thought, consciousness, and so on, are only behavior (whether external behavior or internal behavior) or tendencies towards behaviors."
119,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"A p-zombie that is behaviorally indistinguishable from a normal human being but lacks conscious experiences is therefore not logically possible according to the behaviorist, so an appeal to the logical possibility of a p-zombie furnishes an argument that behaviorism is false."
120,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"Proponents of zombie arguments generally accept that p-zombies are not physically possible, while opponents necessarily deny that they are metaphysically or, in some cases, even logically possible.
"
121,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"The unifying idea of the zombie is of a human that has no conscious experience, but one might distinguish various types of zombie used in different thought experiments as follows:

A behavioral zombie that is behaviorally indistinguishable from a human.
"
122,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"A neurological zombie that has a human brain and is generally physiologically indistinguishable from a human.
"
123,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"A soulless zombie that lacks a soul.
"
124,2,Philosophical zombie,Types of zombies,"A zombie universe that is identical to our world in all physical ways, except no being in that world has qualia."
125,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,Zombie arguments often support lines of reasoning that aim to show that zombies are metaphysically possible in order to support some form of dualism – in this case the view that the world includes two kinds of substance (or perhaps two kinds of property); the mental and the physical.
126,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"According to physicalism, physical facts determine all other facts."
127,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"Since any fact other than that of consciousness may be held to be the same for a p-zombie and a normal conscious human, it follows that physicalism must hold that p-zombies are either not possible or are the same as normal humans.
"
128,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,The zombie argument is a version of general modal arguments against physicalism such as that of Saul Kripke and the kind of physicalism known as type-identity theory.
129,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,Further such arguments were notably advanced in the 1970s by Thomas Nagel (1970; 1974) and Robert Kirk (1974)
130,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,but the general argument was most famously developed in detail by David Chalmers in The Conscious Mind (1996).
131,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"According to Chalmers one can coherently conceive of an entire zombie world, a world physically indistinguishable from this world but entirely lacking conscious experience."
132,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,The counterpart of every conscious being in our world would be a p-zombie.
133,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"Since such a world is conceivable, Chalmers claims, it is metaphysically possible, which is all the argument requires."
134,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"Chalmers states: ""Zombies are probably not naturally possible: they probably cannot exist in our world, with its laws of nature."
135,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"The outline structure of Chalmers' version of the zombie argument is as follows;

"
136,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"According to physicalism, all that exists in our world (including consciousness) is physical.
"
137,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"Thus, if physicalism is true, a metaphysically possible world in which all physical facts are the same as those of the actual world must contain everything that exists in our actual world."
138,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"In particular, conscious experience must exist in such a possible world.
"
139,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,In fact we can conceive of a world physically indistinguishable from our world but in which there is no consciousness (a zombie world).
140,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"From this (so Chalmers argues) it follows that such a world is metaphysically possible.
"
141,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"Therefore, physicalism is false."
142,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,(The conclusion follows from 2.
143,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,and 3. by modus tollens.)The above is a strong formulation of the zombie argument.
144,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,There are other formulations of the zombies-type argument which follow the same general form.
145,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,The premises of the general zombies argument are implied by the premises of all the specific zombie arguments.
146,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,A general zombies argument is in part motivated by potential disagreements between various anti-physicalist views.
147,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"For example, an anti-physicalist view can consistently assert that p-zombies are metaphysically impossible but that inverted qualia (such as inverted spectra) or absent qualia (partial zombiehood) are metaphysically possible."
148,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,Premises regarding inverted qualia or partial zombiehood can substitute premises regarding p-zombies to produce variations of the zombie argument.
149,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,The metaphysical possibility of a physically indistinguishable world with either inverted qualia or partial zombiehood would imply that physical truths don't metaphysically necessitate phenomenal truths.
150,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"To formulate the general form of the zombies argument, take the sentence 'P' to be true if and only if the conjunct of all microphysical truths of our world obtain, take the sentence 'Q' to be true if some phenomenal truth, that obtains in the actual world, obtains."
151,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"The general argument goes as follows.

"
152,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"It is conceivable that P is true and Q is not true.
"
153,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"If it is conceivable that P is true and Q is not true then it is metaphysically possible that P is true and Q not true.
"
154,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,If it is metaphysically possible that P is true and Q is not true then
155,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"physicalism is false.
"
156,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,"Therefore, physicalism is false."
157,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,Q can be false in a possible world if any of the following obtains: (1) there exists at least one invert relative to the actual world
158,2,Philosophical zombie,Zombie arguments,(2) there is at least one absent quale relative to the actual world (3) all actually conscious beings are p-zombies (all actual qualia are absent qualia).
159,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"If one accepts two-dimensional semantics, Chalmers' argument is logically valid."
160,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Some philosophers accept its validity but dispute its soundness, arguing that its premises are false."
161,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Zombies might not actually be conceivable or, if they are, just because they are conceivable, that might not mean that they are possible."
162,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Chalmers has argued that zombies are conceivable, saying ""it certainly seems that a coherent situation is described; I can discern no contradiction in the description."
163,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"This leads to the questions of the relevant notion of ""possibility"": if something is conceivable, does that mean it is possible?"
164,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Most physicalist responses deny that the premise of a zombie scenario is possible.
"
165,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Many physicalist philosophers have argued that this scenario eliminates itself by its description; the basis of a physicalist argument is that the world is defined entirely by physicality; thus, a world that was physically identical would necessarily contain consciousness, as consciousness would necessarily be generated from any set of physical circumstances identical to our own.
"
166,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,One can hold that zombies are a logical possibility but not a metaphysical possibility.
167,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"If logical possibility does not entail metaphysical possibility across the domain of relevant truths, then the mere logical possibility of zombies is not sufficient to establish their metaphysical possibility."
168,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"The zombie argument claims that one can tell by the power of reason that such a ""zombie scenario"" is metaphysically possible."
169,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Chalmers states; ""From the conceivability of zombies, proponents of the argument infer their metaphysical possibility"" and argues that this inference, while not generally legitimate, is legitimate for phenomenal concepts such as consciousness since we must adhere to ""Kripke's insight that for phenomenal concepts, there is no gap between reference-fixers and reference (or between primary and secondary intentions)."
170,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"That is, for phenomenal concepts, conceivability implies possibility."
171,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"According to Chalmers, whatever is logically possible is also, in the sense relevant here, metaphysically possible."
172,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Another response is the denial of the idea that qualia and related phenomenal notions of the mind are in the first place coherent concepts.
173,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Daniel Dennett and others argue that while consciousness and subjective experience exist in some sense, they are not as the zombie argument proponent claims."
174,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"The experience of pain, for example, is not something that can be stripped off a person's mental life without bringing about any behavioral or physiological differences."
175,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Dennett believes that consciousness is a complex series of functions and ideas.
176,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"If we all can have these experiences the idea of the p-zombie is meaningless.
"
177,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Dennett argues that ""when philosophers claim that zombies are conceivable, they invariably underestimate the task of conception (or imagination), and end up imagining something that violates their own definition""."
178,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"He coined the term ""zimboes"" – p-zombies that have second-order beliefs – to argue that the idea of a p-zombie is incoherent; ""Zimboes thinkZ they are conscious, thinkZ they have qualia, thinkZ they suffer pains –"
179,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition), in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!""."
180,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Under (reductive) physicalism, one is inclined to believe either that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie – following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being, or not being a zombie is (just) a product of the physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's."
181,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"P-zombies in an observed world would be indistinguishable from the observer, even hypothetically (when the observer makes no assumptions regarding the validity of their convictions)."
182,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Furthermore, when concept of self is deemed to correspond to physical reality alone (reductive physicalism), philosophical zombies are denied by definition."
183,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"When a distinction is made in one's mind between a hypothetical zombie and oneself (assumed not to be a zombie), the hypothetical zombie, being a subset of the concept of oneself, must entail a deficit in observables (cognitive systems), a ""seductive error"" contradicting the original definition of a zombie.

184,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Verificationism states that, for words to have meaning, their use must be open to public verification."
185,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Since it is assumed that we can talk about our qualia, the existence of zombies is impossible."
186,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"A related argument is that of ""zombie-utterance""."
187,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"If someone were to say they love the smell of some food, a zombie producing the same reaction would be perceived as a person having complex thoughts and ideas in their head indicated by the ability to vocalize it."
188,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,If zombies were without awareness of their perceptions the idea of uttering words could not occur to them.
189,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Therefore, if a zombie has the ability to speak, it is not a zombie.
"
190,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Artificial intelligence researcher Marvin Minsky saw the argument as circular.
191,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"The proposition of the possibility of something physically identical to a human but without subjective experience assumes that the physical characteristics of humans are not what produces those experiences, which is exactly what the argument was claiming to prove."
192,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Richard Brown agrees that the zombie argument is circular.
193,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"To show this, he proposes ""zoombies"", which are creatures nonphysically identical to people in every way and lacking phenomenal consciousness."
194,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"If zoombies existed, they would refute dualism because they would show that consciousness is not nonphysical, i.e., is physical."
195,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Paralleling the argument from Chalmers: It's conceivable that zoombies exist, so it's possible they exist, so dualism is false."
196,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Given the symmetry between the zombie and zoombie arguments, we can't arbitrate the physicalism/dualism question a priori."
197,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Stephen Yablo's (1998) response is to provide an error theory to account for the intuition that zombies are possible.
198,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Notions of what counts as physical and as physically possible change over time so conceptual analysis is not reliable here.
199,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Yablo says he is ""braced for the information that is going to make zombies inconceivable, even though I have no real idea what form the information is going to take.""The zombie argument is difficult to assess because it brings to light fundamental disagreements about the method and scope of philosophy itself and the nature and abilities of conceptual analysis."
200,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Proponents of the zombie argument may think that conceptual analysis is a central part of (if not the only part of) philosophy and that it certainly can do a great deal of philosophical work.
201,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"However others, such as Dennett, Paul Churchland and W.V.O. Quine, have fundamentally different views."
202,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"For this reason, discussion of the zombie argument remains vigorous in philosophy.
"
203,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Some accept modal reasoning in general but deny it in the zombie case.
204,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Christopher S. Hill and Brian P. Mclaughlin suggest that the zombie thought experiment combines imagination of a ""sympathetic"" nature (putting oneself in a phenomenal state) and a ""perceptual"" nature (imagining becoming aware of something in the outside world)."
205,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Each type of imagination may work on its own, but they're not guaranteed to work when both used at the same time."
206,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,Hence Chalmers's argument needn't go through.
207,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Moreover, while Chalmers defuses criticisms of the view that conceivability can tell us about possibility, he provides no positive defense of the principle."
208,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"As an analogy, the generalized continuum hypothesis has no known counterexamples, but this doesn't mean we must accept it."
209,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"And indeed, the fact that Chalmers concludes we have epiphenomenal mental states that don't cause our physical behavior seems one reason to reject his principle."
210,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"Another way to construe the zombie hypothesis is epistemically – as a problem of causal explanation, rather than as a problem of logical or metaphysical possibility."
211,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"The ""explanatory gap"" –"
212,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,"also called the ""hard problem of consciousness"
213,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,""" – is the claim that  (to date) no one has provided a convincing causal explanation of how and why we are conscious."
214,2,Philosophical zombie,Responses,It is a manifestation of the very same gap that (to date) no one has provided a convincing causal explanation of how and why we are not zombies.
215,2,Philosophical zombie,Related thought-experiments,"Frank Jackson's Mary's room argument is based around a hypothetical scientist, Mary, who is forced to view the world through a black-and-white television screen in a black and white room."

217,2,Philosophical zombie,Related thought-experiments,"Even though Mary knows everything about color and its perception (e.g. what combination of wavelengths makes the sky seem blue), she has never seen color."
218,2,Philosophical zombie,Related thought-experiments,"If Mary were released from this room and were to experience color for the first time, would she learn anything new?"
219,2,Philosophical zombie,Related thought-experiments,"Jackson initially believed this supported epiphenomenalism (mental phenomena are the effects, but not the causes, of physical phenomena) but later changed his views to physicalism, suggesting that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world.

229,2,Uncanny valley,Etymology,The concept was identified by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori as bukimi no tani genshō (不気味の谷現象) in 1970.
230,2,Uncanny valley,Etymology,The term was first translated as uncanny valley in the 1978 book Robots:
231,2,Uncanny valley,Etymology,"Fact, Fiction, and Prediction, written by Jasia Reichardt, thus forging an unintended link to Ernst Jentsch's concept of the uncanny, introduced in a 1906 essay entitled ""On the Psychology of the Uncanny""."
232,2,Uncanny valley,Etymology,"Jentsch's conception was elaborated by Sigmund Freud in a 1919 essay entitled ""The Uncanny"" (""Das Unheimliche"")."
233,2,Uncanny valley,Hypothesis,"Mori's original hypothesis states that as the appearance of a robot is made more human, some observers' emotional response to the robot becomes increasingly positive and empathetic, until it reaches a point beyond which the response quickly becomes strong revulsion."
234,2,Uncanny valley,Hypothesis,"However, as the robot's appearance continues to become less distinguishable from a human being, the emotional response becomes positive once again and approaches human-to-human empathy levels."
235,2,Uncanny valley,Hypothesis,"This area of repulsive response aroused by a robot with appearance and motion between a ""barely human"" and ""fully human"" entity is the uncanny valley."
236,2,Uncanny valley,Hypothesis,"The name captures the idea that an almost human-looking robot seems overly ""strange"" to some human beings, produces a feeling of uncanniness, and thus fails to evoke the empathic response required for productive human–robot interaction."
237,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"A number of theories have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanism underlying the phenomenon:

Mate selection."
238,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Automatic, stimulus-driven appraisals of uncanny stimuli elicit aversion by activating an evolved cognitive mechanism for the avoidance of selecting mates with low fertility, poor hormonal health, or ineffective immune systems based on visible features of the face and body that are predictive of those traits.
"
239,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Mortality salience.
240,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Viewing an ""uncanny"" robot elicits an innate fear of death and culturally-supported defenses for coping with death's inevitability...."
241,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"[P]artially disassembled androids...play on subconscious fears of reduction, replacement, and annihilation: (1) A mechanism with a human façade and a mechanical interior plays on our subconscious fear that we are all just soulless machines."
242,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"(2) Androids in various states of mutilation, decapitation, or disassembly are reminiscent of a battlefield after a conflict and, as such, serve as a reminder of our mortality."
243,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"(3) Since most androids are copies of actual people, they are doppelgängers and may elicit a fear of being replaced, on the job, in a relationship, and so on."
244,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,(4)
245,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,The jerkiness of an android's movements could be unsettling because it elicits a fear of losing bodily control.
246,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"""
Pathogen avoidance."
247,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Uncanny stimuli may activate a cognitive mechanism that originally evolved to motivate the avoidance of potential sources of pathogens by eliciting a disgust response.
248,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"The more human an organism looks, the stronger the aversion to its defects, because (1) defects indicate disease, (2) more human-looking organisms are more closely related to human beings genetically, and (3) the probability of contracting disease-causing bacteria, viruses, and other parasites increases with genetic similarity."
249,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"The visual anomalies of androids, robots, and other animated human characters cause reactions of alarm and revulsion, similar to corpses and visibly diseased individuals.
"
250,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Sorites paradoxes.
251,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Stimuli with human and nonhuman traits undermine our sense of human identity by linking qualitatively different categories, human and nonhuman, by a quantitative metric, degree of human likeness.
"
252,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Violation of human norms.
253,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"The uncanny valley may ""be symptomatic of entities that elicit a model of a human other but do not measure up to it""."
254,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"If an entity looks sufficiently nonhuman, its human characteristics are noticeable, generating empathy."
255,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"However, if the entity looks almost human, it elicits our model of a human other and its detailed normative expectations."
256,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"The nonhuman characteristics are noticeable, giving the human viewer a sense of strangeness."
257,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"In other words, a robot stuck inside the uncanny valley is no longer judged by the standards of a robot doing a passable job at pretending to be human, but is instead judged by the standards of a human doing a terrible job at acting like a normal person."
258,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"This has been linked to perceptual uncertainty and the theory of predictive coding.
"
259,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Religious definition of human identity.
260,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,The existence of artificial but humanlike entities is viewed by some as a threat to the concept of human identity.
261,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,An example can be found in the theoretical framework of psychiatrist Irvin Yalom.
262,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Yalom explains that humans construct psychological defenses in order to avoid existential anxiety stemming from death.
263,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"One of these defenses is specialness, the irrational belief that aging and death as central premises of life apply to all others but oneself."
264,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"The experience of the very humanlike ""living"" robot can be so rich and compelling that it challenges humans' notions of ""specialness"" and existential defenses, eliciting existential anxiety."
265,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"In folklore, the creation of human-like, but soulless, beings is often shown to be unwise, as with the golem in Judaism, whose absence of human empathy and spirit can lead to disaster, however good the intentions of its creator.
"
266,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Conflicting perceptual cues.
267,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,The negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations.
268,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Perceptual tension occurs when an individual perceives conflicting cues to category membership, such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot, or has other visible robot features."
269,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"This cognitive conflict is experienced as psychological discomfort (i.e., ""eeriness""), much like the discomfort that is experienced with cognitive dissonance."
270,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Several studies support this possibility.
271,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Mathur and Reichling found that the time subjects took to gauge a robot face's human- or mechanical-resemblance peaked for faces deepest in the uncanny valley, suggesting that perceptually classifying these faces as ""human"" or ""robot"" posed a greater cognitive challenge."
272,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"However, they found that while perceptual confusion coincided with the uncanny valley, it did not mediate the effect of the uncanny valley on subjects' social and emotional reactions—suggesting that perceptual confusion may not be the mechanism behind the uncanny valley effect."
273,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Burleigh and colleagues demonstrated that faces at the midpoint between human and non-human stimuli produced a level of reported eeriness that diverged from an otherwise linear model relating human-likeness to affect.
274,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Yamada et al. found that cognitive difficulty was associated with negative affect at the midpoint of a morphed continuum (e.g., a series of stimuli morphing between a cartoon dog and a real dog)."
275,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Ferrey et al. demonstrated that the midpoint between images on a continuum anchored by two stimulus categories produced a maximum of negative affect, and found this with both human and non-human entities."
276,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Schoenherr and Burleigh provide examples from history and culture that evidence an aversion to hybrid entities, such as the aversion to genetically modified organisms (""Frankenfoods"")."
277,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Finally, Moore developed a Bayesian mathematical model that provides a quantitative account of perceptual conflict."
278,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,There has been some debate as to the precise mechanisms that are responsible.
279,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"It has been argued that the effect is driven by categorization difficulty, perceptual mismatch, frequency-based sensitization, and inhibitory devaluation.
"
280,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Threat to humans' distinctiveness and identity.
281,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,Negative reactions toward very humanlike robots can be related to the challenge that this kind of robot leads to the categorical human – non-human distinction.
282,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Kaplan  stated that these new machines challenge human uniqueness, pushing for a redefinition of humanness."
283,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,MacDorman and Entenzari  investigated the distinction of human and robots as an individual trait that can predict sensitivity to the uncanny valley phenomenon.
284,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"Ferrari, Paladino and Jetten  found that the increase of anthropomorphic appearance of a robot leads to an enhancement of threat to the human distinctiveness and identity."
285,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,"The more a robot resembles a real person,"
286,2,Uncanny valley,Theoretical basis,the more it represents a challenge to our social identity as human beings.
287,2,Uncanny valley,Research,A series of studies experimentally investigated whether uncanny valley effects exist for static images of robot faces.
288,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"Mathur MB & Reichling DB used two complementary sets of stimuli spanning the range from very mechanical to very human-like: first, a sample of 80 objectively chosen robot face images from Internet searches, and second, a morphometrically and graphically controlled 6-face series set of faces."
289,2,Uncanny valley,Research,They asked subjects to explicitly rate the likability of each face.
290,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"To measure trust toward each face, subjects completed a one-shot investment game to indirectly measure how much money they were willing to ""wager"" on a robot's trustworthiness."
291,2,Uncanny valley,Research,Both stimulus sets showed a robust uncanny valley effect on explicitly-rated likability and a more context-dependent uncanny valley on implicitly-rated trust.
292,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"Their exploratory analysis of one proposed mechanism for the uncanny valley, perceptual confusion at a category boundary, found that category confusion occurs in the uncanny valley but does not mediate the effect on social and emotional responses.
"
293,2,Uncanny valley,Research,One study conducted in 2009 examined the evolutionary mechanism behind the aversion associated with the uncanny valley.
294,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"A group of five monkeys were shown three images: two different 3D monkey faces (realistic, unrealistic), and a real photo of a monkey's face."
295,2,Uncanny valley,Research,The monkeys' eye-gaze was used as a proxy for preference or aversion.
296,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"Since the realistic 3D monkey face was looked at less than either the real photo, or the unrealistic 3D monkey face, this was interpreted as an indication that the monkey participants found the realistic 3D face aversive, or otherwise preferred the other two images."
297,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"As one would expect with the uncanny valley, more realism can lead to less positive reactions, and this study demonstrated that neither human-specific cognitive processes, nor human culture explain the uncanny valley."
298,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"In other words, this aversive reaction to realism can be said to be evolutionary in origin."
299,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"As of 2011, researchers at University of California, San Diego and California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology are measuring human brain activations related to the uncanny valley."
300,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"In one study using fMRI, a group of cognitive scientists and roboticists found the biggest differences in brain responses for uncanny robots in parietal cortex, on both sides of the brain, specifically in the areas that connect the part of the brain's visual cortex that processes bodily movements with the section of the motor cortex thought to contain mirror neurons."
301,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"The researchers say they saw, in essence, evidence of mismatch or perceptual conflict."
302,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"The brain ""lit up"" when the human-like appearance of the android and its robotic motion ""didn't compute""."
303,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"Ayşe Pınar Saygın, an assistant professor from UCSD, says ""The brain doesn't seem selectively tuned to either biological appearance or biological motion per se."
304,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"What it seems to be doing is looking for its expectations to be met – for appearance and motion to be congruent.""Viewer"
305,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"perception of facial expression and speech and the uncanny valley in realistic, human-like characters intended for video games and film is being investigated by Tinwell et al., 2011."
306,2,Uncanny valley,Research,Consideration is also given by Tinwell et al.
307,2,Uncanny valley,Research,(2010) as to how the uncanny may be exaggerated for antipathetic characters in survival horror games.
308,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"Building on the body of work already undertaken in android science, this research intends to build a conceptual framework of the uncanny valley using 3D characters generated in a real-time gaming engine."
309,2,Uncanny valley,Research,The goal is to analyze how cross-modal factors of facial expression and speech can exaggerate the uncanny.
310,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"Tinwell et al., 2011 have also introduced the notion of an unscalable uncanny wall that suggests that a viewer's discernment for detecting imperfections in realism will keep pace with new technologies in simulating realism."
311,2,Uncanny valley,Research,"A summary of Angela Tinwell's research on the uncanny valley, psychological reasons behind the uncanny valley and how designers may overcome the uncanny in human-like virtual characters is provided in her book, The Uncanny Valley in Games and Animation by CRC Press."
312,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"A number of design principles have been proposed for avoiding the uncanny valley:

Design elements should match in human realism."
313,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,A robot may look uncanny when human and nonhuman elements are mixed.
314,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"For example, both a robot with a synthetic voice or a human being with a human voice have been found to be less eerie than a robot with a human voice or a human being with a synthetic voice."
315,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"For a robot to give a more positive impression, its degree of human realism in appearance should also match its degree of human realism in behavior."
316,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"If an animated character looks more human than its movement, this gives a negative impression."
317,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"Human neuroimaging studies also indicate matching appearance and motion kinematics are important.
"
318,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"Reducing conflict and uncertainty by matching appearance, behavior, and ability."
319,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"In terms of performance, if a robot looks too appliance-like, people expect little from it; if it looks too human, people expect too much from it."
320,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"A highly human-like appearance leads to an expectation that certain behaviors are present, such as humanlike motion dynamics."
321,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,This likely operates at a sub-conscious level and may have a biological basis.
322,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"Neuroscientists have noted ""when the brain's expectations are not met, the brain...generates a 'prediction error'."
323,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"As human-like artificial agents become more commonplace, perhaps our perceptual systems will be re-tuned to accommodate these new social partners."
324,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"Or perhaps, we will decide ""it is not a good idea to make [robots] so clearly in our image after all."
325,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"""""
Human facial proportions and photorealistic texture should only be used together."
326,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"A photorealistic human texture demands human facial proportions, or the computer generated character can fall into the uncanny valley."
327,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,"Abnormal facial proportions, including those typically used by artists to enhance attractiveness (e.g., larger eyes), can look eerie with a photorealistic human texture."
328,2,Uncanny valley,Design principles,Avoiding a photorealistic texture can permit more leeway.
329,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"A number of criticisms have been raised concerning whether the uncanny valley exists as a unified phenomenon amenable to scientific scrutiny:

Good design can lift human-looking entities out of the valley."
330,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,David Hanson has criticized Mori's hypothesis that entities approaching human appearance will necessarily be evaluated negatively.
331,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"He has shown that the uncanny valley that Karl MacDorman and Hiroshi Ishiguro generated – by having participants rate photographs that morphed from humanoid robots to android robots to human beings – could be flattened out by adding neotenous, cartoonish features to the entities that had formerly fallen into the valley."
332,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"This approach uses the fact that humans find characteristics appealing that are reminiscent of the young of our own (as well as many other) species, as used in cartoons.
"
333,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,The uncanny appears at any degree of human likeness.
334,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"Hanson has also pointed out that uncanny entities may appear anywhere in a spectrum ranging from the abstract (e.g., MIT's robot Lazlo) to the perfectly human (e.g., cosmetically atypical people)."
335,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"Capgras delusion is a relatively rare condition in which the sufferer believes that people (or, in some cases, things) have been replaced with duplicates."
336,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"These duplicates are rationally accepted as identical in physical properties, but the irrational belief is held that the ""true"" entity has been replaced with something else."
337,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,Some sufferers of Capgras delusion claim that the duplicate is a robot.
338,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"Ellis and Lewis argue that the delusion arises from an intact system for overt recognition coupled with a damaged system for covert recognition, which leads to conflict over an individual being identifiable but not familiar in any emotional sense."
339,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"This supports the view that the uncanny valley could arise due to issues of categorical perception that are particular to the way the brain processes information.
"
340,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,The uncanny valley is a heterogeneous group of phenomena.
341,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"Phenomena labeled as being in the uncanny valley can be diverse, involve different sense modalities, and have multiple, possibly overlapping causes, which can range from evolved or learned circuits for early face perception to culturally-shared psychological constructs."
342,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"People's cultural backgrounds may have a considerable influence on how androids are perceived with respect to the uncanny valley.
"
343,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,The uncanny valley may be generational.
344,2,Uncanny valley,Criticism,"Younger generations, more used to CGI, robots, and such, may be less likely to be affected by this hypothesized issue."
345,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"An effect similar to the uncanny valley was noted by Charles Darwin in 1839:

"
346,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"The expression of this [Trigonocephalus] snake's face was hideous and fierce; the pupil consisted of a vertical slit in a mottled and coppery iris; the jaws were broad at the base, and the nose terminated in a triangular projection."
347,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"I do not think I ever saw anything more ugly, excepting, perhaps, some of the vampire bats."
348,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"I imagine this repulsive aspect originates from the features being placed in positions, with respect to each other, somewhat proportional to the human face; and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness.

"
349,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"A similar ""uncanny valley"" effect could, according to the ethical-futurist writer Jamais Cascio, show up when humans begin modifying themselves with transhuman enhancements (cf."
350,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"body modification), which aim to improve the abilities of the human body beyond what would normally be possible, be it eyesight, muscle strength, or cognition."
351,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"So long as these enhancements remain within a perceived norm of human behavior, a negative reaction is unlikely, but once individuals supplant normal human variety, revulsion can be expected."
352,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"However, according to this theory, once such technologies gain further distance from human norms, ""transhuman"" individuals would cease to be judged on human levels and instead be regarded as separate entities altogether (this point is what has been dubbed ""posthuman""), and it is here that acceptance would rise once again out of the uncanny valley."
353,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"Another example comes from ""pageant retouching"" photos, especially of children, which some find disturbingly doll-like."
354,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"Due to rapid advancements in the areas of artificial intelligence and affective computing, cognitive scientists have also suggested the possibility of an ""Uncanny Valley of Mind""."
355,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"Accordingly, people might experience strong feelings of aversion if they encounter highly advanced, emotion-sensitive technology."
356,2,Uncanny valley,Similar effects,"Among the possible explanations for this phenomenon, both a perceived loss of human uniqueness and expectations of immediate physical harm are discussed by contemporary research."
357,2,Uncanny valley,In visual effects,"A number of films that use computer-generated imagery to show characters have been described by reviewers as giving a feeling of revulsion or ""creepiness"" as a result of the characters looking too realistic."
358,2,Uncanny valley,In visual effects,"Examples include the following:

According to roboticist Dario Floreano, the baby character Billy in Pixar's groundbreaking 1988 animated short film Tin Toy provoked negative audience reactions, which first led the film industry to take the concept of the uncanny valley seriously.
"
359,2,Uncanny valley,In visual effects,The 2001 film Final Fantasy:
360,2,Uncanny valley,In visual effects,"The Spirits Within, the first photorealistic computer-animated feature film, provoked negative reactions from some viewers due to its near-realistic yet imperfect visual depictions of human characters."

426,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"Dennett (1971, p. 87) states that he took the concept of ""intentionality"" from the work of the German philosopher Franz Brentano."
427,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"When clarifying the distinction between mental phenomena (viz., mental activity) and physical phenomena, Brentano (p. 97) argued that, in contrast with physical phenomena, the ""distinguishing characteristic of all mental phenomena"" was ""the reference to something as an object"" – a characteristic he called ""intentional inexistence""."
428,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"Dennett constantly speaks of the ""aboutness"" of intentionality; for example: ""the aboutness of the pencil marks composing a shopping list is derived from the intentions of the person whose list it is"" (Dennett, 1995, p. 240).
"
429,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"John Searle (1999, pp."
430,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"85) stresses that ""competence"" in predicting/explaining human behaviour involves being able to both recognize others as ""intentional"" beings, and interpret others' minds as having ""intentional states"" (e.g., beliefs and desires):

"
431,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"""The primary evolutionary role of the mind is to relate us in certain ways to the environment, and especially to other people."
432,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"My subjective states relate me to the rest of the world, and the general name of that relationship is ""intentionality."""
433,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"These subjective states include beliefs and desires, intentions and perceptions, as well as loves and hates, fears and hopes."
434,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"""Intentionality,"" to repeat, is the general term for all the various forms by which the mind can be directed at, or be about, or of, objects and states of affairs in the world."
435,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"(p.85)According to Dennett (1987, pp. 48–49), folk psychology provides a systematic, ""reason-giving explanation"" for a particular action, and an account of the historical origins of that action, based on deeply embedded assumptions  about the agent; namely that:

(a) the agent's action was entirely rational;
(b) the agent's action was entirely reasonable (in the prevailing circumstances);
(c) the agent held certain beliefs;
(d) the agent desired certain things; and
(e) the agent's future action could be systematically predicted from the beliefs and desires so ascribed."
436,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"This approach is also consistent with the earlier work of Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel, whose joint study revealed that, when subjects were presented with an animated display of 2-dimensional shapes, they were inclined to ascribe intentions to the shapes."
437,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"Further, Dennett (1987, p. 52) argues that, based on our fixed personal views of what all humans ought to believe, desire and do, we predict (or explain) the beliefs, desires and actions of others ""by calculating in a normative system""; and, driven by the reasonable assumption that all humans are rational beings – who do have specific beliefs and desires and do act on the basis of those beliefs and desires in order to get what they want"
438,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"– these predictions/explanations are based on four simple rules:

"
439,2,Intentional stance,Dennett and intentionality,"The agent's beliefs are those a rational individual ought to have (i.e., given their ""perceptual capacities"", ""epistemic needs"" and ""biography"");
In general, these beliefs ""are both true and relevant to [their] life;
The agent's desires are those a rational individual ought to have (i.e., given their ""biological needs"", and ""the most practicable means of satisfying them"") in order to further their ""survival"" and ""procreation"" needs; and
The agent's behaviour will be composed of those acts a rational individual holding those beliefs (and having those desires) ought to perform."
440,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"The core idea is that, when understanding, explaining, and/or predicting the behavior of an object, we can choose to view it at varying levels of abstraction."
441,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"The more concrete the level, the more accurate in principle our predictions are; the more abstract, the greater the computational power we gain by zooming out and skipping over the irrelevant details.
"
442,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Dennett defines three levels of abstraction, attained by adopting one of three entirely different ""stances"", or intellectual strategies: the physical stance; the design stance; and the intentional stance:
The most concrete is the physical stance, the domain of physics and chemistry, which makes predictions from knowledge of the physical constitution of the system and the physical laws that govern its operation; and thus, given a particular set of physical laws and initial conditions, and a particular configuration, a specific future state is predicted (this could also be called the ""structure stance"")."
443,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"At this level, we are concerned with such things as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition."
444,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"When we predict where a ball is going to land based on its current trajectory, we are taking the physical stance."
445,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Another example of this stance comes when we look at a strip made up of two types of metal bonded together and predict how it will bend as the temperature changes, based on the physical properties of the two metals.
"
446,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Somewhat more abstract is the design stance, the domain of biology and engineering, which requires no knowledge of the physical constitution or the physical laws that govern a system's operation."
447,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Based on an implicit assumption that there is no malfunction in the system, predictions are made from knowledge of the purpose of the system's design (this could also be called the ""teleological stance"")."
448,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"At this level, we are concerned with such things as purpose, function and design."
449,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"When we predict that a bird will fly when it flaps its wings on the basis that wings are made for flying, we are taking the design stance."
450,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Likewise, we can understand the bimetallic strip as a particular type of thermometer, not concerning ourselves with the details of how this type of thermometer happens to work."
451,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,We can also recognize the purpose that this thermometer serves inside a thermostat and even generalize to other kinds of thermostats that might use a different sort of thermometer.
452,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"We can even explain the thermostat in terms of what it's good for, saying that it keeps track of the temperature and turns on the heater whenever it gets below a minimum, turning it off once it reaches a maximum.
"
453,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Most abstract is the intentional stance, the domain of software and minds, which requires no knowledge of either structure or design, and ""[clarifies] the logic of mentalistic explanations of behaviour, their predictive power, and their relation to other forms of explanation"" (Bolton & Hill, 1996, p. 24)."
454,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Predictions are made on the basis of explanations expressed in terms of meaningful mental states; and, given the task of predicting or explaining the behaviour of a specific agent (a person, animal, corporation, artifact, nation, etc.), it is implicitly assumed that the agent will always act on the basis of its beliefs and desires in order to get precisely what it wants (this could also be called the ""folk psychology stance"")."
455,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"At this level, we are concerned with such things as belief, thinking and intent."
456,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"When we predict that the bird will fly away because it knows the cat is coming and is afraid of getting eaten, we are taking the intentional stance."
457,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Another example would be when we predict that Mary will leave the theater and drive to the restaurant because she sees that the movie is over and is hungry.
"
458,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"In 1971, Dennett also postulated that, whilst ""the intentional stance presupposes neither lower stance"", there may well be a fourth, higher level: a ""truly moral stance toward the system"
459,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,""" – the ""personal stance"""
460,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"which not only ""presupposes the intentional stance"" (viz., treats the system as rational) but also ""views it as a person"" (1971/1978, p. 240).A key point is that switching to a higher level of abstraction has its risks as well as its benefits."
461,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"For example, when we view both a bimetallic strip and a tube of mercury as thermometers, we can lose track of the fact that they differ in accuracy and temperature range, leading to false predictions as soon as the thermometer is used outside the circumstances for which it was designed."
462,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,The actions of a mercury thermometer heated to 500 °C can no longer be predicted on the basis of treating it as a thermometer; we have to sink down to the physical stance to understand it as a melted and boiled piece of junk.
463,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"For that matter, the ""actions"" of a dead bird are not predictable in terms of beliefs or desires.
"
464,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Even when there is no immediate error, a higher-level stance can simply fail to be useful."
465,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"If we were to try to understand the thermostat at the level of the intentional stance, ascribing to it beliefs about how hot it is and a desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no traction over the problem as compared to staying at the design stance, but we would generate theoretical commitments that expose us to absurdities, such as the possibility of the thermostat not being in the mood to work today because the weather is so nice."
466,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Whether to take a particular stance, then, is determined by how successful that stance is when applied.
"
467,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Dennett argues that it is best to understand human behavior at the level of the intentional stance, without making any specific commitments to any deeper reality of the artifacts of folk psychology."
468,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"In addition to the controversy inherent in this, there is also some dispute about the extent to which Dennett is committing to realism about mental properties."
469,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Initially, Dennett's interpretation was seen as leaning more towards instrumentalism, but over the years, as this idea has been used to support more extensive theories of consciousness, it has been taken as being more like Realism."
470,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"His own words hint at something in the middle, as he suggests that the self is as real as a center of gravity, ""an abstract object, a theorist's fiction"", but operationally valid."
471,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"As a way of thinking about things, Dennett's intentional stance is entirely consistent with everyday commonsense understanding; and, thus, it meets Eleanor Rosch's (1978, p. 28) criterion of the ""maximum information with the least cognitive effort""."
472,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Rosch argues that, implicit within any system of categorization, are the assumptions that:

(a) the major purpose of any system of categorization is to reduce the randomness of the universe by providing ""maximum information with the least cognitive effort"", and
(b) the real world is structured and systematic, rather than being arbitrary or unpredictable."
473,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Thus, if a particular way of categorizing information does, indeed, ""provide maximum information with the least cognitive effort"", it can only do so because the structure of that particular system of categories corresponds with the perceived structure of the real world."
474,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Also, the intentional stance meets the criteria Dennett specified (1995, pp."
475,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,50–51)
476,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"for algorithms:

"
477,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"(1) Substrate Neutrality: It is a ""mechanism"" that produces results regardless of the material used to perform the procedure (""the power of the procedure is due to its logical structure, not the causal powers of the materials used in the instantiation"").
"
478,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,(2) Underlying Mindlessness:
479,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"Each constituent step, and each transition between each step, is so utterly simple, that they can be performed by a ""dutiful idiot"".
"
480,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,(3) Guaranteed Results:
481,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,"""Whatever it is that an algorithm does, it always does it, if it is executed without misstep."
482,2,Intentional stance,Dennett's three levels,An algorithm is a foolproof recipe.
483,2,Intentional stance,Variants of Dennett's three stances,"The general notion of a three level system was widespread in the late 1970s/early 1980s; for example, when discussing the mental representation of information from a cognitive psychology perspective, Glass and his colleagues (1979, p. 24) distinguished three important aspects of representation:

(a) the content (""what is being represented"");
(b) the code (""the format of the representation""); and
(c) the medium (""the physical realization of the code"").Other significant cognitive scientists who also advocated a three level system were Allen Newell, Zenon Pylyshyn, and David Marr."
484,2,Intentional stance,Variants of Dennett's three stances,The parallels between the four representations (each of which implicitly assumed that computers and human minds displayed each of the three distinct levels) are detailed in the following table:
485,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"The most obvious objection to Dennett is the intuition that it ""matters"" to us whether an object has an inner life or not."
486,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"The claim is that we don't just imagine the intentional states of other people in order to predict their behaviour; the fact that they have thoughts and feelings just like we do is central to notions such as trust, friendship and love."
487,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"The Blockhead argument proposes that someone, Jones, has a twin who is in fact not a person but a very sophisticated robot which looks and acts like Jones in every way, but who (it is claimed) somehow does not have any thoughts or feelings at all, just a chip which controls his behaviour; in other words, ""the lights are on but no one's home""."
488,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"According to the intentional systems theory (IST), Jones and the robot have precisely the same beliefs and desires, but this is claimed to be false."
489,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"The IST expert assigns the same mental states to Blockhead as he does to Jones, ""whereas in fact [Blockhead] has not a thought in his head.""  "
490,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"Dennett has argued against this by denying the premise, on the basis that the robot is a philosophical zombie and therefore metaphysically impossible.  "
491,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"In other words, if something acts in all ways conscious, it necessarily is, as consciousness is defined in terms of behavioral capacity, not ineffable qualia."
492,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,Another objection attacks the premise that treating people as ideally rational creatures will yield the best predictions.
493,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"Stephen Stich argues that people often have beliefs or desires which are irrational or bizarre, and IST doesn't allow us to say anything about these."
494,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"If the person's ""environmental niche"" is examined closely enough, and the possibility of malfunction in their brain (which might affect their reasoning capacities) is looked into, it may be possible to formulate a predictive strategy specific to that person."
495,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,Indeed this is what we often do when someone is behaving unpredictably
496,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,we look for the reasons why.
497,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"In other words, we can only deal with irrationality by contrasting it against the background assumption of rationality."
498,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"This development significantly undermines the claims of the intentional stance argument.
"
499,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,"The rationale behind the intentional stance is based on evolutionary theory, particularly the notion that the ability to make quick predictions of a system's behaviour based on what we think it might be thinking was an evolutionary adaptive advantage."
500,2,Intentional stance,Objections and replies,The fact that our predictive powers are not perfect is a further result of the advantages sometimes accrued by acting contrary to expectations.
501,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,"Philip Robbins and Anthony I. Jack suggest that ""Dennett's philosophical distinction between the physical and intentional stances has a lot going for it"" from the perspective of psychology and neuroscience."
502,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,"They review studies on abilities to adopt an intentional stance (variously called ""mindreading,"" ""mentalizing,"" or ""theory of mind"") as distinct from adopting a physical stance (""folk physics,"" ""intuitive physics,"" or ""theory of body"")."
503,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,"Autism seems to be a deficit in the intentional stance with preservation of the physical stance, while Williams syndrome can involve deficits in the physical stance with preservation of the intentional stance."
504,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,This tentatively suggests a double dissociation of intentional and physical stances in the brain.
505,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,"However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints."
506,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,"Robbins and Jack point to a 2003 study in which participants viewed animated geometric shapes in different ""vignettes,"" some of which could be interpreted as constituting social interaction, while others suggested mechanical behavior."
507,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,"Viewing social interactions elicited activity in brain regions associated with identifying faces and biological objects (posterior temporal cortex), as well as emotion processing (right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex)."
508,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,"Meanwhile, the mechanical interactions activated regions related to identifying objects like tools that can be manipulated (posterior temporal lobe)."
509,2,Intentional stance,Neural evidence,"The authors suggest ""that these findings reveal putative 'core systems' for social and mechanical understanding that are divisible into constituent parts or elements with distinct processing and storage capabilities."
510,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,Robbins and Jack argue for an additional stance beyond the three that Dennett outlined.
511,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,"They call it the phenomenal stance: Attributing consciousness, emotions, and inner experience to a mind."
512,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,The explanatory gap of the hard problem of consciousness illustrates this tendency of people to see phenomenal experience as different from physical processes.
513,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,"The authors suggest that psychopathy may represent a deficit in the phenomenal but not intentional stance, while people with autism appear to have intact moral sensibilities, just not mind-reading abilities."
514,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,These examples suggest a double dissociation between the intentional and phenomenal stances.
515,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,"In a follow-up paper, Robbins and Jack describe four experiments about how the intentional and phenomenal stances relate to feelings of moral concern."
516,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,The first two experiments showed that talking about lobsters as strongly emotional led to a much greater sentiment that lobsters deserved welfare protections than did talking about lobsters as highly intelligent.
517,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,The third and fourth studies found that perceiving an agent as vulnerable led to greater attributions of phenomenal experience.
518,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,"Also, people who scored higher on the empathetic-concern subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index had generally higher absolute attributions of mental experience."
519,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,Bryce Huebner (2010) performed two experimental philosophy studies to test students' ascriptions of various mental states to humans compared with cyborgs and robots.
520,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,"Experiment 1 showed that while students attributed both beliefs and pains most strongly to humans, they were more willing to attribute beliefs than pains to robots and cyborgs."
521,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,[T]hese data seem to confirm that commonsense psychology does draw a distinction between phenomenal and non-phenomenal states--and this distinction seems to be dependent on the structural properties of an entity in a way that ascriptions of non-phenomenal states are not.
522,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,"However, this conclusion is only tentative in view of the high variance among participants."
523,2,Intentional stance,Phenomenal stance,"Experiment 2 showed analogous results: Both beliefs and happiness were ascribed most strongly to biological humans, and ascriptions of happiness to robots or cyborgs were less common than ascriptions of beliefs."
524,2,Chatbot,Background,"In 1950, Alan Turing's famous article ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" was published, which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence."
525,2,Chatbot,Background,"This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human."
526,2,Chatbot,Background,"The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human."
527,2,Chatbot,Background,"However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:

"
528,2,Chatbot,Background,"[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer."
529,2,Chatbot,Background,"But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ..."
530,2,Chatbot,Background,"The observer says to himself ""I could have written that""."
531,2,Chatbot,Background,"With that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked ""intelligent"", to that reserved for curios ..."
532,2,Chatbot,Background,"The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be ""explained""."
533,2,Chatbot,Background,"Few programs ever needed it more.
"
534,2,Chatbot,Background,"ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY')."
535,2,Chatbot,Background,"Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial."
536,2,Chatbot,Background,"ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate, because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpreted as ""intelligent"".
"
537,2,Chatbot,Background,Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—can be exploited for useful purposes.
538,2,Chatbot,Background,"Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories."
539,2,Chatbot,Background,"Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a ""friendlier"" interface than a more formal search or menu system."
540,2,Chatbot,Background,"This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's ""shelf ... reserved for curios"" to that marked ""genuinely useful computational methods""."
541,2,Chatbot,Development,The classic historic early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972).
542,2,Chatbot,Development,"More recent notable programs include A.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E"
543,2,Chatbot,Development,(Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006).
544,2,Chatbot,Development,"While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities."
545,2,Chatbot,Development,"In 1984, a book called The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing."
546,2,Chatbot,Development,"Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required."
547,2,Chatbot,Development,"For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so called, Alicebots."
548,2,Chatbot,Development,"Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966."
549,2,Chatbot,Development,"This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.
"
550,2,Chatbot,Development,"Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database."
551,2,Chatbot,Development,Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithms that optimise their ability to communicate based on each conversation held.
552,2,Chatbot,Development,"Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect, information retrieval.
"
553,2,Chatbot,Development,Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals.
554,2,Chatbot,Development,"Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however materials can still be found from web archives).DBpedia created a chatbot during the GSoC of 2017. and can communicate through Facebook Messenger."
555,2,Chatbot,Development,"DBpedia started in 2007 and allows to extract structured content from the Wikipedia dataset, along with many other datasets."
556,2,Chatbot,Development,DBpedia is currently one of the biggest representatives of Linked Open Data (LOD).
557,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,Many companies' chatbots run on messaging apps or simply via SMS.
558,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,"They are used for B2C customer service, sales and marketing."
559,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,"In 2016, Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform."
560,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,"There were 30,000 bots created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017.
"
561,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,"Since September 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp."
562,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,"Airlines KLM and Aeroméxico both announced their participation in the testing; both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform.
"
563,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,"The bots usually appear as one of the user's contacts, but can sometimes act as participants in a group chat.
"
564,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,"Many banks, insurers, media companies, e-commerce companies, airlines, hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities and restaurant chains have used chatbots to answer simple questions, increase customer engagement, for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them."
565,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.
566,2,Chatbot,Messaging apps,"According to a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020."
567,2,Chatbot,Company internal platforms,"Other companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally, for example for Customer Support, Human Resources, or even in Internet-of-Things (IoT) projects."
568,2,Chatbot,Company internal platforms,"Overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to automate certain simple yet time-consuming processes when requesting for a sick leave."
569,2,Chatbot,Company internal platforms,"Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Renault and Citroën are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide a first point of contact."
570,2,Chatbot,Company internal platforms,"A SaaS chatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the F8 Conference when Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg unveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app.
"
571,2,Chatbot,Company internal platforms,"In large companies, like in hospitals and aviation organizations, IT architects are designing reference architectures for Intelligent Chatbots that are used to unlock and share knowledge and experience in the organization more efficiently, and reduce the errors in answers from expert service desks significantly."
572,2,Chatbot,Company internal platforms,"These Intelligent Chatbots make use of all kinds of artificial intelligence like image moderation and natural language understanding (NLU), natural language generation (NLG), machine learning and deep learning."
573,2,Chatbot,Banking,Nowadays a high majority of high-tech banking organizations are looking for integration of automated AI-based solutions such as chatbots in their customer service in order to provide faster and cheaper assistance to their clients becoming increasingly technodexterous.
574,2,Chatbot,Banking,"In particularly, chatbots can efficiently conduct a dialogue, usually substituting other communication tools such as email, phone, or SMS."
575,2,Chatbot,Banking,"In banking area their major application is related to quick customer service answering common requests, and transactional support.
"
576,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Several studies accomplished by analytics agencies such as Juniper or Gartner  report significant reduction of cost of customer services, leading to billions of dollars of economy in the next 10 years."
577,2,Chatbot,Banking,Gartner predicts an integration by 2020 of chatbots in at least 85% of all client's applications to customer service.
578,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Juniper's study announces an impressive amount of $8 billion retained annually by 2022 due to the use of chatbots.
"
579,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Since 2016 when Facebook allows businesses to deliver automated customer support, e-commerce guidance, content and interactive experiences through chatbots, a large variety of chatbots for Facebook Messenger platform were developed.
"
580,2,Chatbot,Banking,"In 2016, Russia-based Tochka Bank launched the world's first Facebook bot for a range of financial services, in particularly including a possibility of making payments.

"
581,2,Chatbot,Banking,"In July 2016, Barclays Africa also launched a Facebook chatbot, making it the first bank to do so in Africa.
"
582,2,Chatbot,Banking,The France's third largest bank by total assets
583,2,Chatbot,Banking,Société Générale launched their chatbot called SoBot in March 2018.
584,2,Chatbot,Banking,"While the 80% of users of the SoBot express their satisfaction after having tested it, il will never replace the expertise provided by a human advisor according to SG deputy director Bertrand Cozzarolo.
"
585,2,Chatbot,Banking,"There are several potential advantages of using chatbots in interaction with customer in banking:
Cost reduction."
586,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Chatbots eliminate the obligation of any human presence during online interaction and are so long seen as a huge advantage by companies operating with multiple repetitive queries at once as long as they don't require any decision-making procedure.
"
587,2,Chatbot,Banking,Human touch.
588,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Chatbots, providing an interface similar to human-to-human interaction, are more intuitive and so less difficult to use than a standard banking mobile application."
589,2,Chatbot,Banking,They do not require any additional software installation and are more adaptive as able to be personalized during the exploitation by the means of machine learning.
590,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Chatbots are instant and so much faster that phone calls, shown to be considered as tedious in some studies."
591,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Then they satisfy both speed and personalization requirement while interacting with a bank.
"
592,2,Chatbot,Banking,Financial advice.
593,2,Chatbot,Banking,"State-of-the-art banking assistants can, by accessing personal customer's data such as consumer behavior or history of purchases, provide useful information on client's account and use it to develop AI-Based recommendations for better adapted money management.
"
594,2,Chatbot,Banking,Attracting new clients.
595,2,Chatbot,Banking,"A chatbot greeting a bank's website guest can provide some useful and relevant information, helping to exploit the offered products and services in a personalized manner helps to attract the potential client and the he is more likely to end by creation of a new account.
"
596,2,Chatbot,Banking,24/7 digital support.
597,2,Chatbot,Banking,An instant and always accessible assistant is assumed by the more and more digital consumer of the new era.
598,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Unlike humans, chatbots once developed and installed don't have a limited workdays, holidays or weekends and are ready to attend queries at any hour of the day."
599,2,Chatbot,Banking,It helps to the customer to avoid waiting of a company's agent to be available.
600,2,Chatbot,Banking,"Thus, the customer doesn't have to wait for the company executive to help them."
601,2,Chatbot,Banking,This also lets companies keep an eye on the traffic during the non-working hours and reach out to them later.
602,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,Chatbots are also appearing in the healthcare industry.
603,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,"A study suggested that physicians in the United States believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments, locating health clinics, or providing medication information."
604,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,Certain patient groups are still reluctant to use chatbots.
605,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,"A mixed-methods study showed that people are still hesitant to use chatbots for their healthcare due to poor understanding of the technological complexity, the lack of empathy and concerns about cyber-security.  "
606,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,"The analysis showed that while 6% had heard of a health chatbot and 3% had experience of using it, 67% perceived themselves as likely to use one within 12 months."
607,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,"The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information (78%), booking a medical appointment (78%) and looking for local health services (80%)."
608,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,"However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health."
609,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%).
610,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,"While 80% were curious about new technologies that could improve their health, 66% reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and 65% thought that a chatbot was a good idea."
611,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,"Interestingly, 30% reported dislike about talking to computers, 41% felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot."
612,2,Chatbot,Healthcare,"Therefore, perceived trustworthiness, individual attitudes towards bots and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots."
613,2,Chatbot,Politics,"In New Zealand, the chatbot SAM -short for Semantic Analysis Machine-"
614,2,Chatbot,Politics,(made by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech) has been developed.
615,2,Chatbot,Politics,"It is designed to share its political thoughts, for example on topics such as climate change, healthcare and education, etc."
616,2,Chatbot,Politics,It talks to people through Facebook Messenger.
617,2,Chatbot,Toys,Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing such as toys.
618,2,Chatbot,Toys,"Hello Barbie is an Internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk, which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children."
619,2,Chatbot,Toys,These characters' behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.
620,2,Chatbot,Toys,IBM's Watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such as CogniToys intended to interact with children for educational purposes.
621,2,Chatbot,Chatbot development platforms,"The process of building, testing and deploying chatbots can be done on cloud-based chatbot development platforms offered by cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers such as Oracle Cloud Platform  SnatchBot and IBM Watson."
622,2,Chatbot,Chatbot development platforms,"These cloud platforms provide Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Backend as a Service for chatbot development.
"
623,2,Chatbot,Chatbot development platforms,"API
"
624,2,Chatbot,Chatbot development platforms,Some Companies like Microsoft Azure and AARC are currently providing their Bot Engines through which chatbot Platforms or Software can be developed.
625,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,"Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements, by mimicking human behavior and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers."
626,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,They are commonly found on Yahoo!
627,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,"Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and other instant messaging protocols."
628,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service's website.
629,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,"Tay, an AI chatbot that learns from previous interaction, caused major controversy due to it being targeted by internet trolls on Twitter."
630,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,"The bot was exploited, and after 16 hours began to send extremely offensive Tweets to users."
631,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,"This suggests that although the bot learnt effectively from experience, adequate protection was not put in place to prevent misuse."
632,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,"If a text-sending algorithm can pass itself off as a human instead of a chatbot, its message would be more credible."
633,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,"Therefore, human-seeming chatbots with well-crafted online identities could start scattering fake news that seem plausible, for instance making false claims during a presidential election."
634,2,Chatbot,Malicious use,"With enough chatbots, it might be even possible to achieve artificial social proof."
635,2,Chatbot,Limitations of Chatbots,"The creation and implementation of chatbots is still a developing area, heavily related to artificial intelligence and machine learning, so the provided solutions, while possessing obvious advantages, have some important limitations in terms of functionalities and use cases."
636,2,Chatbot,Limitations of Chatbots,"However this is changing over time.
"
637,2,Chatbot,Limitations of Chatbots,"The most common ones are listed below:
As the database, used for output generation, is fixed and limited, chatbots can fail while dealing with an unsaved query.
"
638,2,Chatbot,Limitations of Chatbots,"A chatbot's efficiency highly depends on language processing and is limited because of irregularities, such as accents and mistakes that can create an important barrier for international and multi-cultural organisations
Chatbots are unable to deal with multiple questions at the same time and so conversation opportunities are limited.
"
639,2,Chatbot,Limitations of Chatbots,"As it happens usually with technology-led changes in existing services, some consumers, more often than not from the old generation, are uncomfortable with chatbots due to their limited understanding, making it obvious that their requests are being dealt machines."
640,2,Chatbot,Chatbots and jobs,Chatbots are increasingly present in businesses and often are used to automate tasks that do not require skill-based talents.
641,2,Chatbot,Chatbots and jobs,"With customer service taking place via messaging apps as well as phone calls, there are growing numbers of use-cases where chatbot deployment gives organisations a clear return on investment."
642,2,Chatbot,Chatbots and jobs,Call centre workers may be particularly at risk from AI-driven chatbots.
643,2,Chatbot,Chatbots and jobs,A study by Forrester (June 2017) predicts that 25% of today's jobs will most likely be impacted by AI technologies by 2019.

653,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"The term derives from the Greek σημειωτικός sēmeiōtikos, ""observant of signs"" (from σημεῖον sēmeion, ""a sign, a mark"") and it was first used in English prior to 1676 by Henry Stubbe (spelt semeiotics) in a very precise sense to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs."
654,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"John Locke used the term sem(e)iotike in book four, chapter 21 of An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)."
655,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Here he explains how science may be divided into three parts:

All that can fall within the compass of human understanding, being either, first, the nature of things, as they are in themselves, their relations, and their manner of operation: or, secondly, that which man himself ought to do, as a rational and voluntary agent, for the attainment of any end, especially happiness: or, thirdly, the ways and means whereby the knowledge of both the one and the other of these is attained and communicated; I think science may be divided properly into these three sorts.

"
656,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Locke then elaborates on the nature of this third category, naming it Σημειωτική (Semeiotike) and explaining it as ""the doctrine of signs"" in the following terms:

"
657,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick, but an exact knowledge of medicinal physiology (founded on observation, not principles), semiotics, method of curing, and tried (not excogitated, not commanding) medicines.

"
658,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"In the nineteenth century, Charles Sanders Peirce defined what he termed ""semiotic"" (which he sometimes spelled as ""semeiotic"") as the ""quasi-necessary, or formal doctrine of signs"", which abstracts ""what must be the characters of all signs used by ... an intelligence capable of learning by experience"", and which is philosophical logic pursued in terms of signs and sign processes."
659,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"The Peirce scholar and editor Max H. Fisch claimed in 1978 that ""semeiotic"" was Peirce's own preferred rendering of Locke's σημιωτική.
"
660,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Charles W. Morris followed Peirce in using the term ""semiotic"" and in extending the discipline beyond human communication to animal learning and use of signals.
"
661,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Ferdinand de Saussure, however, founded his semiotics, which he called semiology, in the social sciences:

"
662,2,Semiotics,Terminology,It is... possible to conceive of a science which studies the role of signs as part of social life.
663,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"It would form part of social psychology, and hence of general psychology."
664,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"We shall call it semiology (from the Greek semeîon, 'sign')."
665,2,Semiotics,Terminology,It would investigate the nature of signs and the laws governing them.
666,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Since it does not yet exist, one cannot say for certain that it will exist."
667,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"But it has a right to exist, a place ready for it in advance."
668,2,Semiotics,Terminology,Linguistics is only one branch of this general science.
669,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"The laws which semiology will discover will be laws applicable in linguistics, and linguistics will thus be assigned to a clearly defined place in the field of human knowledge.

"
670,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"While the Saussurean semiotic is dyadic (sign/syntax, signal/semantics), the Peircean semiotic is triadic (sign, object, interpretant), being conceived as philosophical logic studied in terms of signs that are not always linguistic or artificial."
671,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"The Peircean semiotic addresses not only the external communication mechanism, as per Saussure, but the internal representation machine, investigating not just sign processes, or modes of inference, but the whole inquiry process in general."
672,2,Semiotics,Terminology,Peircean semiotics further subdivides each of the three triadic elements into three sub-types.
673,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"For example, signs can be icons, indices, and symbols.
"
674,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Yuri Lotman introduced Eastern Europe to semiotics and adopted Locke's coinage as the name to subtitle (Σημειωτική) his founding at the University of Tartu in Estonia in 1964 of the first semiotics journal, Sign Systems Studies.
"
675,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Thomas Sebeok assimilated ""semiology"" to ""semiotics"" as a part to a whole, and was involved in choosing the name Semiotica for the first international journal devoted to the study of signs.
"
676,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"Saussurean semiotics have been challenged with serious criticism, for example by Jacques Derrida's assertion that signifier and signified are not fixed, coining the expression différance, relating to the endless deferral of meaning, and to the absence of a 'transcendent signified'."
677,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"For Derrida, 'il n'y a pas de hors-texte'"
678,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"(""there is nothing outside the text"")."
679,2,Semiotics,Terminology,"He was in obvious opposition to materialists and marxists who argued that a sign has to point towards a real meaning, and cannot be controlled by the referent's closed-loop references."
680,2,Semiotics,History,"The importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of philosophy, and in psychology as well."
681,2,Semiotics,History,"Plato and Aristotle both explored the relationship between signs and the world, and Augustine of Hippo considered the nature of the sign within a conventional system."
682,2,Semiotics,History,"These theories have had a lasting effect in Western philosophy, especially through scholastic philosophy."
683,2,Semiotics,History,"(More recently, Umberto Eco, in his Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language, has argued that semiotic theories are implicit in the work of most, perhaps all, major thinkers.)

684,2,Semiotics,History,"The general study of signs that began in Latin with Augustine culminated with the 1632 Tractatus de Signis of John Poinsot, and then began anew in late modernity with the attempt in 1867 by Charles Sanders Peirce to draw up a ""new list of categories""."
685,2,Semiotics,History,"Peirce aimed to base his new list directly upon experience precisely as constituted by action of signs, in contrast with the list of Aristotle's categories which aimed to articulate within experience the dimension of being that is independent of experience and knowable as such, through human understanding.
"
686,2,Semiotics,History,"The estimative powers of animals interpret the environment as sensed to form a ""meaningful world"" of objects, but the objects of this world (or ""Umwelt"", in Jakob von Uexküll's term,) consist exclusively of objects related to the animal as desirable (+), undesirable (–), or ""safe to ignore"" (0).
"
687,2,Semiotics,History,"In contrast to this, human understanding adds to the animal ""Umwelt"" a relation of self-identity within objects which transforms objects experienced into things as well as +, –, 0 objects."
688,2,Semiotics,History,"Thus, the generically animal objective world as ""Umwelt"", becomes a species-specifically human objective world or ""Lebenswelt"" (life-world), wherein linguistic communication, rooted in the biologically underdetermined ""Innenwelt"" (inner-world) of humans, makes possible the further dimension of cultural organization within the otherwise merely social organization of non-human animals whose powers of observation may deal only with directly sensible instances of objectivity."
689,2,Semiotics,History,"This further point, that human culture depends upon language understood first of all not as communication, but as the biologically underdetermined aspect or feature of the human animal's ""Innenwelt"", was originally clearly identified by Thomas A. Sebeok."
690,2,Semiotics,History,"Sebeok also played the central role in bringing Peirce's work to the center of the semiotic stage in the twentieth century, first with his expansion of the human use of signs (""anthroposemiosis"") to include also the generically animal sign-usage (""zoösemiosis""), then with his further expansion of semiosis (based initially on the work of Martin Krampen, but taking advantage of Peirce's point that an interpretant, as the third item within a sign relation, ""need not be mental"") to include the vegetative world (""phytosemiosis"").
"
691,2,Semiotics,History,Peirce's distinguished between the interpretant and the interpreter.
692,2,Semiotics,History,"The interpretant is the internal, mental representation that mediates between the object and its sign."
693,2,Semiotics,History,The interpreter is the human who is creating the interpretant.
694,2,Semiotics,History,"Peirce's ""interpretant"" notion opened the way to understanding an action of signs beyond the realm of animal life (study of ""phytosemiosis"" + ""zoösemiosis"" + ""anthroposemiosis"" = biosemiotics), which was his first advance beyond Latin Age semiotics."
695,2,Semiotics,History,Other early theorists in the field of semiotics include Charles W. Morris.
696,2,Semiotics,History,Max Black argued that the work of Bertrand Russell was seminal in the field.
697,2,Semiotics,Formulations,Semioticians classify signs or sign systems in relation to the way they are transmitted (see modality).
698,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"This process of carrying meaning depends on the use of codes that may be the individual sounds or letters that humans use to form words, the body movements they make to show attitude or emotion, or even something as general as the clothes they wear."
699,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"To coin a word to refer to a thing (see lexical words), the community must agree on a simple meaning (a denotative meaning) within their language, but that word can transmit that meaning only within the language's grammatical structures and codes (see syntax and semantics)."
700,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Codes also represent the values of the culture, and are able to add new shades of connotation to every aspect of life.
"
701,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"To explain the relationship between semiotics and communication studies, communication is defined as the process of transferring data and-or meaning from a source to a receiver."
702,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Hence, communication theorists construct models based on codes, media, and contexts to explain the biology, psychology, and mechanics involved."
703,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Both disciplines recognize that the technical process cannot be separated from the fact that the receiver must decode the data, i.e., be able to distinguish the data as salient, and make meaning out of it."
704,2,Semiotics,Formulations,This implies that there is a necessary overlap between semiotics and communication.
705,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Indeed, many of the concepts are shared, although in each field the emphasis is different."
706,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"In Messages and Meanings: An Introduction to Semiotics, Marcel Danesi (1994) suggested that semioticians' priorities were to study signification first, and communication second."
707,2,Semiotics,Formulations,A more extreme view is offered by Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1987; trans.
708,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"1990: 16), who, as a musicologist, considered the theoretical study of communication irrelevant to his application of semiotics.

"
709,2,Semiotics,Formulations,Semiotics differs from linguistics in that it generalizes the definition of a sign to encompass signs in any medium or sensory modality.
710,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Thus it broadens the range of sign systems and sign relations, and extends the definition of language in what amounts to its widest analogical or metaphorical sense."
711,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"The branch of semiotics that deals with such formal relations between signs or expressions in abstraction from their signification and their interpreters, or – more generally – with formal properties of symbol systems (specifically – with reference to linguistic signs – syntax) is referred to as syntactics.
"
712,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Peirce's definition of the term ""semiotic"" as the study of necessary features of signs also has the effect of distinguishing the discipline from linguistics as the study of contingent features that the world's languages happen to have acquired in the course of their evolutions."
713,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"From a subjective standpoint, perhaps more difficult is the distinction between semiotics and the philosophy of language."
714,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"In a sense, the difference lies between separate traditions rather than subjects."
715,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Different authors have called themselves ""philosopher of language"" or ""semiotician""."
716,2,Semiotics,Formulations,This difference does not match the separation between analytic and continental philosophy.
717,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"On a closer look, there may be found some differences regarding subjects."
718,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Philosophy of language pays more attention to natural languages or to languages in general, while semiotics is deeply concerned with non-linguistic signification."
719,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Philosophy of language also bears connections to linguistics, while semiotics might appear closer to some of the humanities (including literary theory) and to cultural anthropology.
"
720,2,Semiotics,Formulations,Semiosis or semeiosis is the process that forms meaning from any organism's apprehension of the world through signs.
721,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Scholars who have talked about semiosis in their subtheories of semiotics include C. S. Peirce, John Deely, and Umberto Eco."
722,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Cognitive semiotics is combining methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with providing new information into human signification and its manifestation in cultural practices."
723,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"The research on cognitive semiotics brings together semiotics from linguistics, cognitive science, and related disciplines on a common meta-theoretical platform of concepts, methods, and shared data.
"
724,2,Semiotics,Formulations,Cognitive semiotics may also be seen as the study of meaning-making by employing and integrating methods and theories developed in the cognitive sciences.
725,2,Semiotics,Formulations,This involves conceptual and textual analysis as well as experimental investigations.
726,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Cognitive semiotics initially was developed at the Center for Semiotics at Aarhus University (Denmark), with an important connection with the Center of Functionally Integrated Neuroscience (CFIN) at Aarhus Hospital."
727,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Amongst the prominent cognitive semioticians are Per Aage Brandt, Svend Østergaard, Peer Bundgård, Frederik Stjernfelt, Mikkel Wallentin, Kristian Tylén, Riccardo Fusaroli, and Jordan Zlatev."
728,2,Semiotics,Formulations,"Zlatev later in co-operation with Göran Sonesson established CCS (Center for Cognitive Semiotics) at Lund University, Sweden."
729,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), a noted logician who founded philosophical pragmatism, defined semiosis as an irreducibly triadic process wherein something, as an object, logically determines or influences something as a sign to determine or influence something as an interpretation or interpretant, itself a sign, thus leading to further interpretants."
730,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,Semiosis is logically structured to perpetuate itself.
731,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"The object may be quality, fact, rule, or even fictional (Hamlet), and may be ""immediate"" to the sign, the object as represented in the sign, or ""dynamic"", the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded."
732,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"The interpretant may be ""immediate"" to the sign, all that the sign immediately expresses, such as a word's usual meaning; or ""dynamic"", such as a state of agitation; or ""final"" or ""normal"", the ultimate ramifications of the sign about its object, to which inquiry taken far enough would be destined and with which any interpretant, at most, may coincide."
733,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"His semiotic covered not only artificial, linguistic, and symbolic signs, but also semblances such as kindred sensible qualities, and indices such as reactions."
734,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"He came c. 1903 to classify any sign by three interdependent trichotomies, intersecting to form ten (rather than 27) classes of sign."
735,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,Signs also enter into various kinds of meaningful combinations; Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his speculative grammar.
736,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"He regarded formal semiotic as logic per se and part of philosophy; as also encompassing study of arguments (hypothetical, deductive, and inductive) and inquiry's methods including pragmatism; and as allied to, but distinct from logic's pure mathematics."
737,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"In addition to pragmatism, Peirce provided a definition of the term ""sign"" as:""A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity."
738,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign."
739,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign.
740,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"The sign stands for something, its object not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea."
741,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"Peirce called the sign a representamen, in order to bring out the fact that a sign is something that ""represents"" something else in order to suggest it (that is, ""re-present"" it) in some way."
742,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"For a summary of Peirce's contributions to semiotics, see Liszka (1996) or Atkin (2006).Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), the ""father"" of modern linguistics, proposed a dualistic notion of signs, relating the signifier as the form of the word or phrase uttered, to the signified as the mental concept."
743,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"According to Saussure, the sign is completely arbitrary"
744,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,—i.e.
745,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,", there is no necessary connection between the sign and its meaning."
746,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"This sets him apart from previous philosophers, such as Plato or the scholastics, who thought that there must be some connection between a signifier and the object it signifies."
747,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"In his Course in General Linguistics, Saussure credits the American linguist William Dwight Whitney (1827–1894) with insisting on the arbitrary nature of the sign."
748,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"Saussure's insistence on the arbitrariness of the sign also has influenced later philosophers and theorists such as Jacques Derrida, Roland Barthes, and Jean Baudrillard."
749,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"Ferdinand de Saussure coined the term sémiologie while teaching his landmark ""Course on General Linguistics"" at the University of Geneva from 1906 to 1911."
750,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,Saussure posited that no word is inherently meaningful.
751,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"Rather a word is only a ""signifier"", i.e., the representation of something, and it must be combined in the brain with the ""signified"", or the thing itself, in order to form a meaning-imbued ""sign""."
752,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"Saussure believed that dismantling signs was a real science, for in doing"
753,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"so we come to an empirical understanding of how humans synthesize physical stimuli into words and other abstract concepts.
"
754,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,Jakob von Uexküll (1864–1944) studied the sign processes in animals.
755,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"He used the German word for ""environment"", umwelt, to describe the individual's subjective world, and he invented the concept of functional circle (funktionskreis) as a general model of sign processes."

Pragmatics:"
766,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"relation between signs and sign-using agents or interpretersSyntactics is the Morris'ean branch of semiotics that deals with the formal properties of signs and symbols; the interrelation of the signs, without regard to meaning."
767,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,Semantics deals with the relation of signs to their designata and the objects that they may or do denote; the relation between the signs and the objects to which they apply.
768,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"Finally, pragmatics deals with the biotic aspects of semiosis, with all the psychological, biological, and sociological phenomena that occur in the functioning of signs; the relation between the sign system and its human (or animal) user."

772,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,Roland Barthes (1915–1980) was a French literary theorist and semiotician.
773,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,He often would critique pieces of cultural material to expose how bourgeois society used them to impose its values upon others.
774,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"For instance, the portrayal of wine drinking in French society as a robust and healthy habit would be a bourgeois ideal perception contradicted by certain realities (i.e. that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating)."
775,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,He found semiotics useful in conducting these critiques.
776,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were second-order signs, or connotations."
777,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"A picture of a full, dark bottle is a sign, a signifier relating to a signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage—wine."
778,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,"However, the bourgeois take this signified and apply their own emphasis to it, making ""wine"" a new signifier, this time relating to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing wine."
779,2,Semiotics,Notable semioticians,Motivations for such manipulations vary from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the status quo.

865,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,Pictorial semiotics is intimately connected to art history and theory.
866,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"It goes beyond them both in at least one fundamental way, however."
867,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"While art history has limited its visual analysis to a small number of pictures that qualify as ""works of art"", pictorial semiotics focuses on the properties of pictures in a general sense, and on how the artistic conventions of images can be interpreted through pictorial codes."
868,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,Pictorial codes are the way in which viewers of pictorial representations seem automatically to decipher the artistic conventions of images by being unconsciously familiar with them.
869,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"According to Göran Sonesson, a Swedish semiotician, pictures can be analyzed by three models: (a) the narrative model, which concentrates on the relationship between pictures and time in a chronological manner as in a comic strip; (b) the rhetoric model, which compares pictures with different devices as in a metaphor; and (c) the laokoon (or laocoon) model, which considers the limits and constraints of pictorial expressions by comparing textual mediums that utilize time with visual mediums that utilize space."
870,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,The break from traditional art history and theory—as well as from other major streams of semiotic analysis—leaves open a wide variety of possibilities for pictorial semiotics.
871,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"Some influences have been drawn from phenomenological analysis, cognitive psychology, structuralist, and cognitivist linguistics, and visual anthropology and sociology.
"
872,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"One of the many ways that pictorial semiotics has been changing has been through the use of emojis in email, text or other online conversations."
873,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"Though not seen as works of art, these small images of happy, sad, winking faces or even a smiling poo image, have made their way into our everyday communication through digital devices."
874,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"In the early advances of mobile technology and the increasing manner in which such devices are used, many in the linguistic community felt that vital communication cues, such as the importance of nonverbal cues, would be lost."
875,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"Another concern is that with the high use of these symbols would begin to oversimplify our language to where the language's strength would be lost.
"
876,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"However, others have said that the use of emojis in digital conversation has helped to give more clarity to a conversation."
877,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"Since the ability to read another person's facial expressions, nonverbal cues or tone of voice isn't possible in a typed message, emojis allow a communicator to convey attitudes and emotions to their message receiver."
878,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"As for oversimplifying our language, some have argued that perhaps our language is not being simplified, but that new generations are revitalizing the early forms of semiotics like cave paintings or hieroglyphics."
879,2,Semiotics,Pictorial semiotics,"As technology advances, so will the use of emojis or possibly a more advanced form of pictorial symbols to use in digital communication."
880,2,Semiotics,Globalization,Studies have shown that semiotics may be used to make or break a brand.
881,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"Culture codes strongly influence whether a population likes or dislikes a brand's marketing, especially internationally."
882,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"If the company is unaware of a culture's codes, it runs the risk of failing in its marketing."
883,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"Globalization has caused the development of a global consumer culture where products have similar associations, whether positive or negative, across numerous markets."
884,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"Mistranslations may lead to instances of ""Engrish"" or ""Chinglish"", terms for unintentionally humorous cross-cultural slogans intended to be understood in English."
885,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"This may be caused by a sign that, in Peirce's terms, mistakenly indexes or symbolizes something in one culture, that it does not in another."
886,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"In other words, it creates a connotation that is culturally-bound, and that violates some culture code."
887,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"Theorists who have studied humor (such as Schopenhauer) suggest that contradiction or incongruity creates absurdity and therefore, humor."
888,2,Semiotics,Globalization,Violating a culture code creates this construct of ridiculousness for the culture that owns the code.
889,2,Semiotics,Globalization,Intentional humor also may fail cross-culturally because jokes are not on code for the receiving culture.
890,2,Semiotics,Globalization,A good example of branding according to cultural code is Disney's international theme park business.
891,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"Disney fits well with Japan's cultural code because the Japanese value ""cuteness"", politeness, and gift giving as part of their culture code; Tokyo Disneyland sells the most souvenirs of any Disney theme park."
892,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"In contrast, Disneyland Paris failed when it launched as Euro Disney because the company did not research the codes underlying European culture."
893,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"Its storybook retelling of European folktales was taken as elitist and insulting, and the strict appearance standards that it had for employees resulted in discrimination lawsuits in France."
894,2,Semiotics,Globalization,Disney souvenirs were perceived as cheap trinkets.
895,2,Semiotics,Globalization,The park was a financial failure because its code violated the expectations of European culture in ways that were offensive.
896,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"On the other hand, some researchers have suggested that it is possible to successfully pass a sign perceived as a cultural icon, such as the Coca-Cola or McDonald's logos, from one culture to another."
897,2,Semiotics,Globalization,This may be accomplished if the sign is migrated from a more economically-developed to a less developed culture.
898,2,Semiotics,Globalization,The intentional association of a product with another culture has been called Foreign Consumer Culture Positioning (FCCP).
899,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"Products also may be marketed using global trends or culture codes, for example, saving time in a busy world; but even these may be fine-tuned for specific cultures."
900,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"Research also found that, as airline industry brandings grow and become more international, their logos become more symbolic and less iconic."
901,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"The iconicity and symbolism of a sign depends on the cultural convention and, are on that ground in relation with each other."
902,2,Semiotics,Globalization,"If the cultural convention has greater influence on the sign, the signs get more symbolic value."
903,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Graffiti is used by gang members to mark their territory and to warn off rivals.
904,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Graffiti is a great example of semiotics and the use of symbols.
905,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"Police task forces are now starting to use a programming system called GARI, they upload pictures of gang symbols that they find"
906,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,and it helps them to decipher the meaning of the symbols.
907,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"Gang members use semiotics and symbols for many different reasons, for example: Government-sanctioned graffiti from the city's Department of Public Works, in red, typically indicates an abandoned building, or the stylized SS stands for South Side, a faction of the 18th Street gang based in southern Indianapolis."
908,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,A rival gang sprayed red Xs over the work as a sign of disrespect.
909,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"In the book The Lost Boyz: A Dark Side of Graffiti by Justin Rollins it talks about how Rollins started writing on trains at a very early age, because it helped him find himself, he was now a graffiti writer –"
910,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,a somebody.
911,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,This is true with a lot of symbols.
912,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,People use symbols to express themselves by getting tattoos or wearing a symbol on their clothing.
913,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,This helps them to feel like they belong to something or it helps them to express themselves.
914,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"Gangs also use their clothing as a symbol, they do something unique for their group so that you aware of the gang you are encountering."
915,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,An example could be a certain pant leg rolled up or wearing a certain color of bandana.
916,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,The book also talks about how Rollins joined a graffiti gang that was called the WK which stands for Who Kares
917,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,but it also had a different meaning which was Wanted Kriminals.
918,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Many symbols in semiotics theory have different meanings; these meanings can be different from country to country or even just from person to person depending on where and how a person was raised.
919,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"For example, in the United States, waving is a form of ""hello"" but in other cultures this could mean something offensive."
920,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Semiotics is anything that can stand for something else.
921,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"A symbol does not stand on its own, it is a part of something, a system perhaps."
922,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Symbols in gangs are used for different things.
923,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Not just to show which gang a person is associated with but to express what has happened in their gang and in their individual lives.
924,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Gangs were first created to strengthen a certain ethnic group.
925,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,They are very territorial.
926,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,To show which territory is theirs they will mark the streets so that other gangs are aware.
927,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"There are special ways to read gang signs and their tattoos: left to right, top to bottom."
928,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,They may also make the tattoo or graffiti cluttered so that it is hard to read.
929,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Each gang has special hand signals or set of signs to identify themselves.
930,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,There are some gangs who add a dot or something similar to their graffiti to stand as a phrase used in their specific gang.
931,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"Each gang is unique and has special symbols, and these symbols usually have some sort of meaning."
932,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"For example, the gang called ""Bloods"" use the color red in their clothing to symbolize they are a part of this specific gang."
933,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,They also are known to use the number 5 and have tattoos and graffiti of a five-point crown.
934,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"The hand sign that they use mostly is a ""b"" which stands for bloods."
935,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Some gangs use graffiti and tattoos more than others as well as using their clothing as a symbol of their gang.
936,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Gangs will also use codes to communicate on the streets.
937,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,They will oftentimes use a number that will relate to a letter of the alphabet.
938,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"Depending on the gang, they may use more complex codes."
939,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Street gangs are known for using graffiti in their neighborhoods to mark their territory.
940,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,Gangs are also using their graffiti to challenge other gangs and to disrespect them.
941,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"When they do this, they will somehow cross the other gang's symbol, and they will use their gang slang as well."
942,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,They make sure to do it in a place that is clear and will leave a direct hit on the other gang.
943,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"Semiotics and gang graffiti merge on the undercarriage of bridges, the face of billboards, on abandoned buildings, storefronts, the sides of railroad cars, and even in inconspicuous places found along dirt roads in small rural areas."
944,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"The idea, is to communicate a message."
945,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,A message that is part of a system.
946,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,It is not uncommon for those outside the culture of gangs to judge the meaning of graffiti and its direct connection to semiotics as completely negative.
947,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"This kind of graffiti was branded ""Graffiti of Grief"" in an article by Gabrielle Luber."
948,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"They are a commemoration of mourning; a ""funeral"" for those who have died on the streets."
949,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"The murals are often created by
members designated within the gang and the artwork is intended to ""provide glimpses of their lives, possessions, friends, and surroundings, and map out for us the identities of lost friends."
950,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,The symbols used in these murals are intentional and communicate significant meanings within the developed culture.
951,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"It is an art, an expression of respect and loyalty."
952,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,It is a portable headstone and is often layered (painted over) with the next memorial of death caused by street violence.
953,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"In its own right, it is a historical timeline, a genealogy of grief, and it is rewritten every day with the same story and a new name."
954,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"Poverty, marginalism, survival, perpetual crisis, inadequate housing, low or no job skills, poor education, and social constraints and constructs will continue to market for the consumption of lives on the streets."
955,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,The symbol of grief portrayed in certain kinds of graffiti suggest a depth of meaning and a place or memorial far beyond what the eye can see.
956,2,Semiotics,Gangs and graffiti,"To an outsider, it may easily be interpreted without compassion."
957,2,Semiotics,Main institutions,"A world organisation of semioticians, the International Association for Semiotic Studies, and its journal Semiotica, was established in 1969."

989,2,Loebner Prize,Prizes,"In 2008, $3,000 was awarded.
"
990,2,Loebner Prize,Prizes,"In addition, there are two one-time-only prizes that have never been awarded."
991,2,Loebner Prize,Prizes,"$25,000 is offered for the first program that judges cannot distinguish from a real human and which can convince judges that the human is the computer program."
992,2,Loebner Prize,Prizes,"$100,000 is the reward for the first program that judges cannot distinguish from a real human in a Turing test that includes deciphering and understanding text, visual, and auditory input."
993,2,Loebner Prize,Prizes,"Once this is achieved, the annual competition will end."
994,2,Loebner Prize,Competition rules and restrictions,"The rules have varied over the years and early competitions featured restricted conversation Turing tests but since 1995 the discussion has been unrestricted.
"
995,2,Loebner Prize,Competition rules and restrictions,"For the three entries in 2007, Robert Medeksza, Noah Duncan and Rollo Carpenter, some basic ""screening questions"" were used by the sponsor to evaluate the state of the technology."
996,2,Loebner Prize,Competition rules and restrictions,"These included simple questions about the time, what round of the contest it is, etc.; general knowledge (""What is a hammer for?""); comparisons (""Which is faster, a train or a plane?""); and questions demonstrating memory for preceding parts of the same conversation."
997,2,Loebner Prize,Competition rules and restrictions,"All nouns, adjectives and verbs will come from a dictionary suitable for children or adolescents under the age of 12."
998,2,Loebner Prize,Competition rules and restrictions,"Entries did not need to respond ""intelligently"" to the questions to be accepted.
"
999,2,Loebner Prize,Competition rules and restrictions,For the first time in 2008 the sponsor allowed introduction of a preliminary phase to the contest opening up the competition to previously disallowed web-based entries judged by a variety of invited interrogators.
1000,2,Loebner Prize,Competition rules and restrictions,The available rules do not state how interrogators are selected or instructed.
1001,2,Loebner Prize,Competition rules and restrictions,"Interrogators (who judge the systems) have limited time: 5 minutes per entity in the 2003 competition, 20+ per pair in 2004–2007 competitions, 5 minutes to conduct simultaneous conversations with a human and the program in 2008-2009, increased to 25 minutes of simultaneous conversation since 2010."
1002,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,"The prize has long been scorned by experts in the field, for a variety of reasons.
"
1003,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,It is regarded by many as a publicity stunt.
1004,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,"Marvin Minsky scathingly offered a ""prize"" to anyone who could stop the competition."
1005,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,Loebner responded by jokingly observing that Minsky's offering a prize to stop the competition effectively made him a co-sponsor.
1006,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,The rules of the competition have encouraged poorly qualified judges to make rapid judgements.
1007,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,"Interactions between judges and competitors was originally very brief, for example effectively 2.5 mins of questioning, which permitted only a few questions."
1008,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,"Questioning was initially restricted to ""whimsical conversation"", a domain suiting standard chatbot tricks."
1009,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,"Competition entrants do not aim at understanding or intelligence but resort to basic ELIZA style tricks, and successful entrants find deception and pretense is rewarded."
1010,2,Loebner Prize,Criticisms,"Reporting of the annual competition often confuses the imitation test with intelligence, a typical example being Brian Christian's introduction to his article ""Mind vs. Machine"" in The Atlantic, March 2011, stating that ""in the race to build computers that can think like humans, the proving ground is the Turing Test""."
1011,2,Loebner Prize,2006,"In 2006, the contest was organised by Tim Child (CEO of Televirtual) and Huma Shah."

1074,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"The question of whether it is possible for machines to think has a long history, which is firmly entrenched in the distinction between dualist and materialist views of the mind."
1075,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,René Descartes prefigures aspects of the Turing test in his 1637 Discourse on the Method when he writes: [H]ow many different automata or moving machines can be made by the industry of man ...
1076,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"For we can easily understand a machine's being constituted so that it can utter words, and even emit some responses to action on it of a corporeal kind, which brings about a change in its organs; for instance, if touched in a particular part it may ask what we wish to say to it; if in another part it may exclaim that it is being hurt, and so on."
1077,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"But it never happens that it arranges its speech in various ways, in order to reply appropriately to everything that may be said in its presence, as even the lowest type of man can do.
"
1078,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,Here Descartes notes that automata are capable of responding to human interactions but argues that such automata cannot respond appropriately to things said in their presence in the way that any human can.
1079,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,Descartes therefore prefigures the Turing test by defining the insufficiency of appropriate linguistic response as that which separates the human from the automaton.
1080,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency, and so does not propose the Turing test as such, even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion.
"
1081,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"Denis Diderot formulates in his Pensées philosophiques a Turing-test criterion:
"
1082,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"If they find a parrot who could answer to everything, I would claim it to be an intelligent being without hesitation.""This does not mean he agrees with this, but that it was already a common argument of materialists at that time.
"
1083,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"According to dualism, the mind is non-physical (or, at the very least, has non-physical properties) and, therefore, cannot be explained in purely physical terms."
1084,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"According to materialism, the mind can be explained physically, which leaves open the possibility of minds that are produced artificially."
1085,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"In 1936, philosopher Alfred Ayer considered the standard philosophical question of other minds: how do we know that other people have the same conscious experiences that we do?"
1086,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"In his book, Language, Truth and Logic, Ayer suggested a protocol to distinguish between a conscious man and an unconscious machine: ""The only ground I can have for asserting that an object which appears to be conscious is not really a conscious being, but only a dummy or a machine, is that it fails to satisfy one of the empirical tests by which the presence or absence of consciousness is determined."
1087,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"(This suggestion is very similar to the Turing test, but is concerned with consciousness rather than intelligence."
1088,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"Moreover, it is not certain that Ayer's popular philosophical classic was familiar to Turing.)"
1089,2,Turing test,Philosophical background,"In other words, a thing is not conscious if it fails the consciousness test."
1090,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Researchers in the United Kingdom had been exploring ""machine intelligence"" for up to ten years prior to the founding of the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research in 1956."
1091,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"It was a common topic among the members of the Ratio Club, who were an informal group of British cybernetics and electronics researchers that included Alan Turing, after whom the test is named."
1092,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Turing, in particular, had been tackling the notion of machine intelligence since at least 1941 and one of the earliest-known mentions of ""computer intelligence"" was made by him in 1947."
1093,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"In Turing's report, ""Intelligent Machinery"", he investigated ""the question of whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour"" and, as part of that investigation, proposed what may be considered the forerunner to his later tests:

"
1094,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,It is not difficult to devise a paper machine which will play a not very bad game of chess.
1095,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,Now get three men as subjects for the experiment.
1096,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"A, B and C. A and C are to be rather poor chess players, B is the operator who works the paper machine."
1097,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,...
1098,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Two rooms are used with some arrangement for communicating moves, and a game is played between C and either A or the paper machine."
1099,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"C may find it quite difficult to tell which he is playing.
"
1100,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" (1950) was the first published paper by Turing to focus exclusively on machine intelligence."
1101,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Turing begins the 1950 paper with the claim, ""I propose to consider the question 'Can machines think?'"
1102,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"As he highlights, the traditional approach to such a question is to start with definitions, defining both the terms ""machine"" and ""intelligence""."
1103,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Turing chooses not to do so; instead he replaces the question with a new one, ""which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words."
1104,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"In essence he proposes to change the question from ""Can machines think?"" to ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"
1105,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"The advantage of the new question, Turing argues, is that it draws ""a fairly sharp line between the physical and intellectual capacities of a man.""To demonstrate this approach"
1106,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Turing proposes a test inspired by a party game, known as the ""imitation game"", in which a man and a woman go into separate rooms and guests try to tell them apart by writing a series of questions and reading the typewritten answers sent back.  "
1107,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,In this game both the man and the woman aim to convince the guests that they are the other.
1108,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,(Huma Shah argues that this two-human version of the game was presented by Turing only to introduce the reader to the machine-human question-answer test.)
1109,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Turing described his new version of the game as follows:

"
1110,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"We now ask the question, ""What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?""  "
1111,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?
1112,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"These questions replace our original, ""Can machines think?"
1113,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"""
Later in the paper"
1114,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Turing suggests an ""equivalent"" alternative formulation involving a judge conversing only with a computer and a man.  "
1115,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"While neither of these formulations precisely matches the version of the Turing test that is more generally known today, he proposed a third in 1952."
1116,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"In this version, which Turing discussed in a BBC radio broadcast, a jury asks questions of a computer and the role of the computer is to make a significant proportion of the jury believe that it is really a man."
1117,2,Turing test,Alan Turing,"Turing's paper considered nine putative objections, which include all the major arguments against artificial intelligence that have been raised in the years since the paper was published (see ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"")."
1118,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created a program which appeared to pass the Turing test."
1119,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"The program, known as ELIZA, worked by examining a user's typed comments for keywords."
1120,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"If a keyword is found, a rule that transforms the user's comments is applied, and the resulting sentence is returned."
1121,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"If a keyword is not found, ELIZA responds either with a generic riposte or by repeating one of the earlier comments."
1122,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"In addition, Weizenbaum developed ELIZA to replicate the behaviour of a Rogerian psychotherapist, allowing ELIZA to be ""free to assume the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world."
1123,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"With these techniques, Weizenbaum's program was able to fool some people into believing that they were talking to a real person, with some subjects being ""very hard to convince that ELIZA [...] is not human."
1124,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"Thus, ELIZA is claimed by some to be one of the programs (perhaps the first) able to pass the Turing test, even though this view is highly contentious (see below).
"
1125,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"Kenneth Colby created PARRY in 1972, a program described as  ""ELIZA with attitude""."
1126,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"It attempted to model the behaviour of a paranoid schizophrenic, using a similar (if more advanced) approach to that employed by Weizenbaum."
1127,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"To validate the work, PARRY was tested in the early 1970s using a variation of the Turing test.  "
1128,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,A group of experienced psychiatrists analysed a combination of real patients and computers running PARRY through teleprinters.
1129,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,Another group of 33 psychiatrists were shown transcripts of the conversations.
1130,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"The two groups were then asked to identify which of the ""patients"" were human and which were computer programs."
1131,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,The psychiatrists were able to make the correct identification only 48 percent of the time –
1132,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,a figure consistent with random guessing.
1133,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"In the 21st century, versions of these programs (now known as ""chatterbots"") continue to fool people."
1134,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"""CyberLover"", a malware program, preys on Internet users by convincing them to ""reveal information about their identities or to lead them to visit a web site that will deliver malicious content to their computers""."
1135,2,Turing test,ELIZA and PARRY,"The program has emerged as a ""Valentine-risk"" flirting with people ""seeking relationships online in order to collect their personal data""."
1136,2,Turing test,The Chinese room,"John Searle's 1980 paper Minds, Brains, and Programs proposed the ""Chinese room"" thought experiment and argued that the Turing test could not be used to determine if a machine can think."
1137,2,Turing test,The Chinese room,Searle noted that software (such as ELIZA) could pass the Turing test simply by manipulating symbols of which they had no understanding.
1138,2,Turing test,The Chinese room,"Without understanding, they could not be described as ""thinking"" in the same sense people are.  "
1139,2,Turing test,The Chinese room,"Therefore, Searle concludes, the Turing test cannot prove that a machine can think."
1140,2,Turing test,The Chinese room,"Much like the Turing test itself, Searle's argument has been both widely criticised and highly endorsed."
1141,2,Turing test,The Chinese room,"Arguments such as Searle's and others working on the philosophy of mind sparked off a more intense debate about the nature of intelligence, the possibility of intelligent machines and the value of the Turing test that continued through the 1980s and 1990s."
1142,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,The Loebner Prize provides an annual platform for practical Turing tests with the first competition held in November 1991.
1143,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,It is underwritten by Hugh Loebner.
1144,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"The Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies in Massachusetts, United States, organised the prizes up to and including the 2003 contest."
1145,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"As Loebner described it, one reason the competition was created is to advance the state of AI research, at least in part, because no one had taken steps to implement the Turing test despite 40 years of discussing it."
1146,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"The first Loebner Prize competition in 1991 led to a renewed discussion of the viability of the Turing test and the value of pursuing it, in both the popular press and academia."
1147,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,The first contest was won by a mindless program with no identifiable intelligence that managed to fool naïve interrogators into making the wrong identification.
1148,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,This highlighted several of the shortcomings of the Turing test (discussed below)
1149,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,": The winner won, at least in part, because it was able to ""imitate human typing errors""; the unsophisticated interrogators were easily fooled; and some researchers in AI have been led to feel that the test is merely a distraction from more fruitful research."
1150,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,The silver (text only) and gold (audio and visual) prizes have never been won.
1151,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"However, the competition has awarded the bronze medal every year for the computer system that, in the judges' opinions, demonstrates the ""most human"" conversational behaviour among that year's entries."
1152,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity (A.L.I.C.E.) has won the bronze award on three occasions in recent times (2000, 2001, 2004)."
1153,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"Learning AI Jabberwacky won in 2005 and 2006.
"
1154,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"The Loebner Prize tests conversational intelligence; winners are typically chatterbot programs, or Artificial Conversational Entities (ACE)s."
1155,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"Early Loebner Prize rules restricted conversations: Each entry and hidden-human conversed on a single topic, thus the interrogators were restricted to one line of questioning per entity interaction."
1156,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,The restricted conversation rule was lifted for the 1995 Loebner Prize.
1157,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,Interaction duration between judge and entity has varied in Loebner Prizes.
1158,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"In Loebner 2003, at the University of Surrey, each interrogator was allowed five minutes to interact with an entity, machine or hidden-human."
1159,2,Turing test,Loebner Prize,"Between 2004 and 2007, the interaction time allowed in Loebner Prizes was more than twenty minutes."
1160,2,Turing test,Versions,"Saul Traiger argues that there are at least three primary versions of the Turing test, two of which are offered in ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" and one that he describes as the ""Standard Interpretation""."
1161,2,Turing test,Versions,"While there is some debate regarding whether the ""Standard Interpretation"" is that described by Turing or, instead, based on a misreading of his paper, these three versions are not regarded as equivalent, and their strengths and weaknesses are distinct."
1162,2,Turing test,Versions,Huma Shah points out that Turing himself was concerned with whether a machine could think and was providing a simple method to examine this: through human-machine question-answer sessions.
1163,2,Turing test,Versions,"Shah argues there is one imitation game which Turing described could be practicalised in two different ways: a) one-to-one interrogator-machine test, and b) simultaneous comparison of a machine with a human, both questioned in parallel by an interrogator."
1164,2,Turing test,Versions,"Since the Turing test is a test of indistinguishability in performance capacity, the verbal version generalises naturally to all of human performance capacity, verbal as well as nonverbal (robotic)."
1165,2,Turing test,Imitation game,Turing's original article describes a simple party game involving three players.
1166,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"Player A is a man, player B is a woman and player C (who plays the role of the interrogator) is of either sex."
1167,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"In the imitation game, player C is unable to see either player A or player B, and can communicate with them only through written notes."
1168,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"By asking questions of player A and player B, player C tries to determine which of the two is the man and which is the woman."
1169,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"Player A's role is to trick the interrogator into making the wrong decision, while player B attempts to assist the interrogator in making the right one."
1170,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"Turing then asks:

What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in this game?"
1171,2,Turing test,Imitation game,Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?
1172,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"These questions replace our original, ""Can machines think?""

"
1173,2,Turing test,Imitation game,The second version appeared later in Turing's 1950 paper.
1174,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"Similar to the original imitation game test, the role of player A is performed by a computer."
1175,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"However, the role of player B is performed by a man rather than a woman.

"
1176,2,Turing test,Imitation game,Let us fix our attention on one particular digital computer C.
1177,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate storage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?
"
1178,2,Turing test,Imitation game,"In this version, both player A (the computer) and player B are trying to trick the interrogator into making an incorrect decision."
1179,2,Turing test,Standard interpretation,"Common understanding has it that the purpose of the Turing test is not specifically to determine whether a computer is able to fool an interrogator into believing that it is a human, but rather whether a computer could imitate a human."
1180,2,Turing test,Standard interpretation,"While there is some dispute whether this interpretation was intended by Turing, Sterrett believes that it was and thus conflates the second version with this one, while others, such as Traiger, do not –"
1181,2,Turing test,Standard interpretation,"this has nevertheless led to what can be viewed as the ""standard interpretation."
1182,2,Turing test,Standard interpretation,"In this version, player A is a computer and player B a person of either sex."
1183,2,Turing test,Standard interpretation,"The role of the interrogator is not to determine which is male and which is female, but which is a computer and which is a human."
1184,2,Turing test,Standard interpretation,"The fundamental issue with the standard interpretation is that the interrogator cannot differentiate which responder is human, and which is machine.  "
1185,2,Turing test,Standard interpretation,"There are issues about duration, but the standard interpretation generally considers this limitation as something that should be reasonable."
1186,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,Controversy has arisen over which of the alternative formulations of the test Turing intended.
1187,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,"Sterrett argues that two distinct tests can be extracted from his 1950 paper and that, pace Turing's remark, they are not equivalent."
1188,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,"The test that employs the party game and compares frequencies of success is referred to as the ""Original Imitation Game Test"", whereas the test consisting of a human judge conversing with a human and a machine is referred to as the ""Standard Turing Test"", noting that Sterrett equates this with the ""standard interpretation"" rather than the second version of the imitation game."
1189,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,"Sterrett agrees that the standard Turing test (STT) has the problems that its critics cite but feels that, in contrast, the original imitation game test (OIG test) so defined is immune to many of them, due to a crucial difference: Unlike the STT, it does not make similarity to human performance the criterion, even though it employs human performance in setting a criterion for machine intelligence."
1190,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,"A man can fail the OIG test, but it is argued that it is a virtue of a test of intelligence that failure indicates a lack of resourcefulness: The OIG test requires the resourcefulness associated with intelligence and not merely ""simulation of human conversational behaviour""."
1191,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,The general structure of the OIG test could even be used with non-verbal versions of imitation games.
1192,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,"Still other writers have interpreted Turing as proposing that the imitation game itself is the test, without specifying how to take into account"
1193,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,"Turing's statement that the test that he proposed using the party version of the imitation game is based upon a criterion of comparative frequency of success in that imitation game, rather than a capacity to succeed at one round of the game.

1194,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,Saygin has suggested that maybe the original game is a way of proposing a less biased experimental design as it hides the participation of the computer.
1195,2,Turing test,Imitation game vs. standard Turing test,"The imitation game also includes a ""social hack"" not found in the standard interpretation, as in the game both computer and male human are required to play as pretending to be someone they are not."
1196,2,Turing test,Should the interrogator know about the computer?,A crucial piece of any laboratory test is that there should be a control.
1197,2,Turing test,Should the interrogator know about the computer?,Turing never makes clear whether the interrogator in his tests is aware that one of the participants is a computer.
1198,2,Turing test,Should the interrogator know about the computer?,"However, if there were a machine that did have the potential to pass a Turing test, it would be safe to assume a double blind control would be necessary.
"
1199,2,Turing test,Should the interrogator know about the computer?,"To return to the original imitation game, he states only that player A is to be replaced with a machine, not that player C is to be made aware of this replacement."
1200,2,Turing test,Should the interrogator know about the computer?,"When Colby, FD Hilf, S Weber and AD Kramer tested PARRY, they did so by assuming that the interrogators did not need to know that one or more of those being interviewed was a computer during the interrogation."
1201,2,Turing test,Should the interrogator know about the computer?,"As Ayse Saygin, Peter Swirski, and others have highlighted, this makes a big difference to the implementation and outcome of the test."
1202,2,Turing test,Should the interrogator know about the computer?,"An experimental study looking at Gricean maxim violations using transcripts of Loebner's one-to-one (interrogator-hidden interlocutor) Prize for AI contests between 1994–1999, Ayse Saygin found significant differences between the responses of participants who knew and did not know about computers being involved."
1203,2,Turing test,Tractability and simplicity,The power and appeal of the Turing test derives from its simplicity.
1204,2,Turing test,Tractability and simplicity,"The philosophy of mind, psychology, and modern neuroscience have been unable to provide definitions of ""intelligence"" and ""thinking"" that are sufficiently precise and general to be applied to machines."
1205,2,Turing test,Tractability and simplicity,"Without such definitions, the central questions of the philosophy of artificial intelligence cannot be answered."
1206,2,Turing test,Tractability and simplicity,"The Turing test, even if imperfect, at least provides something that can actually be measured."
1207,2,Turing test,Tractability and simplicity,"As such, it is a pragmatic attempt to answer a difficult philosophical question."
1208,2,Turing test,Breadth of subject matter,The format of the test allows the interrogator to give the machine a wide variety of intellectual tasks.
1209,2,Turing test,Breadth of subject matter,"Turing wrote that ""the question and answer method seems to be suitable for introducing almost any one of the fields of human endeavour that we wish to include."
1210,2,Turing test,Breadth of subject matter,"John Haugeland adds that ""understanding the words is not enough; you have to understand the topic as well.""To pass a well-designed Turing test, the machine must use natural language, reason, have knowledge and learn."
1211,2,Turing test,Breadth of subject matter,"The test can be extended to include video input, as well as a ""hatch"" through which objects can be passed: this would force the machine to demonstrate the skill of vision and robotics as well."
1212,2,Turing test,Breadth of subject matter,"Together, these represent almost all of the major problems that artificial intelligence research would like to solve."
1213,2,Turing test,Breadth of subject matter,The Feigenbaum test is designed to take advantage of the broad range of topics available to a Turing test.
1214,2,Turing test,Breadth of subject matter,It is a limited form of Turing's question-answer game which compares the machine against the abilities of experts in specific fields such as literature or chemistry.
1215,2,Turing test,Breadth of subject matter,"IBM's Watson machine achieved success in a man versus machine television quiz show of human knowledge, Jeopardy!"
1216,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"As a Cambridge honours graduate in mathematics, Turing might have been expected to propose a test of computer intelligence requiring expert knowledge in some highly technical field, and thus anticipating a more recent approach to the subject.  "
1217,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"Instead, as already noted, the test which he described in his seminal 1950 paper requires the computer to be able to compete successfully in a common party game, and this by performing as well as the typical man in answering a series of questions so as to pretend convincingly to be the woman contestant.
"
1218,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"Given the status of human sexual dimorphism as one of the most ancient of subjects, it is thus implicit in the above scenario that the questions to be answered will involve neither specialised factual knowledge nor information processing technique."
1219,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"The challenge for the computer, rather, will be to demonstrate empathy for the role of the female, and to demonstrate as well a characteristic aesthetic sensibility—both of which qualities are on display in this snippet of dialogue which Turing has imagined:

Interrogator: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair?Contestant:"
1220,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long."
1221,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"When Turing does introduce some specialised knowledge into one of his imagined dialogues, the subject is not maths or electronics, but poetry:

Interrogator:"
1222,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"In the first line of your sonnet which reads, ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day,"" would not ""a spring day"" do as well or better?Witness:     "
1223,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,It wouldn't scan.
1224,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,Interrogator:
1225,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"How about ""a winter's day."
1226,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,That would scan all right.
1227,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,Witness:
1228,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"Yes, but nobody wants to be compared to a winter's day."
1229,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"Turing thus once again demonstrates his interest in empathy and aesthetic sensitivity as components of an artificial intelligence; and in light of an increasing awareness of the threat from an AI run amok, it has been suggested that this focus perhaps represents a critical intuition on Turing's part, i.e., that emotional and aesthetic intelligence will play a key role in the creation of a ""friendly AI"".  "
1230,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"It is further noted, however, that whatever inspiration Turing might be able to lend in this direction depends upon the preservation of his original vision, which is to say, further, that the promulgation of a ""standard interpretation"" of the Turing test—"
1231,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,"i.e., one which focuses on a discursive intelligence"
1232,2,Turing test,Emphasis on emotional and aesthetic intelligence,only—must be regarded with some caution.
1233,2,Turing test,Weaknesses,"Turing did not explicitly state that the Turing test could be used as a measure of intelligence, or any other human quality."
1234,2,Turing test,Weaknesses,"He wanted to provide a clear and understandable alternative to the word ""think"", which he could then use to reply to criticisms of the possibility of ""thinking machines"" and to suggest ways that research might move forward.
"
1235,2,Turing test,Weaknesses,"Nevertheless, the Turing test has been proposed as a measure of a machine's ""ability to think"" or its ""intelligence""."
1236,2,Turing test,Weaknesses,This proposal has received criticism from both philosophers and computer scientists.
1237,2,Turing test,Weaknesses,"It assumes that an interrogator can determine if a machine is ""thinking"" by comparing its behaviour with human behaviour."
1238,2,Turing test,Weaknesses,"Every element of this assumption has been questioned: the reliability of the interrogator's judgement, the value of comparing only behaviour and the value of comparing the machine with a human."
1239,2,Turing test,Weaknesses,"Because of these and other considerations, some AI researchers have questioned the relevance of the test to their field."
1240,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,The Turing test does not directly test whether the computer behaves intelligently.
1241,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,It tests only whether the computer behaves like a human being.
1242,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"Since human behaviour and intelligent behaviour are not exactly the same thing, the test can fail to accurately measure intelligence in two ways:

"
1243,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"Some human behaviour is unintelligent
"
1244,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"The Turing test requires that the machine be able to execute all human behaviours, regardless of whether they are intelligent.  "
1245,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"It even tests for behaviours that may not be considered intelligent at all, such as the susceptibility to insults, the temptation to lie or, simply, a high frequency of typing mistakes."
1246,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,If a machine cannot imitate these unintelligent behaviours in detail it fails the test.
1247,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"This objection was raised by The Economist, in an article entitled ""artificial stupidity"" published shortly after the first Loebner Prize competition in 1992."
1248,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"The article noted that the first Loebner winner's victory was due, at least in part, to its ability to ""imitate human typing errors."
1249,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"Turing himself had suggested that programs add errors into their output, so as to be better ""players"" of the game."
1250,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"Some intelligent behaviour is inhuman
"
1251,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"The Turing test does not test for highly intelligent behaviours, such as the ability to solve difficult problems or come up with original insights.  "
1252,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"In fact, it specifically requires deception on the part of the machine: if the machine is more intelligent than a human being it must deliberately avoid appearing too intelligent."
1253,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"If it were to solve a computational problem that is practically impossible for a human to solve, then the interrogator would know the program is not human, and the machine would fail the test."
1254,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"Because it cannot measure intelligence that is beyond the ability of humans, the test cannot be used to build or evaluate systems that are more intelligent than humans."
1255,2,Turing test,Human intelligence vs. intelligence in general,"Because of this, several test alternatives that would be able to evaluate super-intelligent systems have been proposed."
1256,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,The Turing test is concerned strictly with how the subject acts –
1257,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,the external behaviour of the machine.
1258,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,"In this regard, it takes a behaviourist or functionalist approach to the study of the mind."
1259,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,"The example of ELIZA suggests that a machine passing the test may be able to simulate human conversational behaviour by following a simple (but large) list of mechanical rules, without thinking or having a mind at all.
"
1260,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,"John Searle has argued that external behaviour cannot be used to determine if a machine is ""actually"" thinking or merely ""simulating thinking."
1261,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,"His Chinese room argument is intended to show that, even if the Turing test is a good operational definition of intelligence, it may not indicate that the machine has a mind, consciousness, or intentionality."
1262,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,"(Intentionality is a philosophical term for the power of thoughts to be ""about"" something.)

"
1263,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,"Turing anticipated this line of criticism in his original paper, writing: I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness."
1264,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,"There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it."
1265,2,Turing test,Consciousness vs. the simulation of consciousness,But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.
1266,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"In practice, the test's results can easily be dominated not by the computer's intelligence, but by the attitudes, skill, or naïveté of the questioner.
"
1267,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"Turing does not specify the precise skills and knowledge required by the interrogator in his description of the test, but he did use the term ""average interrogator"": ""[the] average interrogator would not have more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning"".Chatterbot programs such as ELIZA have repeatedly fooled unsuspecting people into believing that they are communicating with human beings."
1268,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"In these cases, the ""interrogators"" are not even aware of the possibility that they are interacting with computers."
1269,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"To successfully appear human, there is no need for the machine to have any intelligence whatsoever and only a superficial resemblance to human behaviour is required.
"
1270,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"Early Loebner Prize competitions used ""unsophisticated"" interrogators who were easily fooled by the machines."
1271,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"Since 2004, the Loebner Prize organisers have deployed philosophers, computer scientists, and journalists among the interrogators."
1272,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"Nonetheless, some of these experts have been deceived by the machines."
1273,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"Michael Shermer points out that human beings consistently choose to consider non-human objects as human whenever they are allowed the chance, a mistake called the anthropomorphic fallacy: They talk to their cars, ascribe desire and intentions to natural forces (e.g., ""nature abhors a vacuum""), and worship the sun as a human-like being with intelligence."
1274,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"If the Turing test is applied to religious objects, Shermer argues, then, that inanimate statues, rocks, and places have consistently passed the test throughout history."
1275,2,Turing test,Naïveté of interrogators and the anthropomorphic fallacy,"This human tendency towards anthropomorphism effectively lowers the bar for the Turing test, unless interrogators are specifically trained to avoid it."
1276,2,Turing test,Human misidentification,"One interesting feature of the Turing test is the frequency of the confederate effect, when the confederate (tested) humans are misidentified by the interrogators as machines."
1277,2,Turing test,Human misidentification,It has been suggested that what interrogators expect as human responses is not  necessarily typical of humans.
1278,2,Turing test,Human misidentification,"As a result, some individuals can be categorised as machines."
1279,2,Turing test,Human misidentification,This can therefore work in favour of a competing machine.
1280,2,Turing test,Human misidentification,"The humans are instructed to ""act themselves"", but sometimes their answers are more like what the interrogator expects a machine to say."
1281,2,Turing test,Human misidentification,"This raises the question of how to ensure that the humans are motivated to ""act human""."
1282,2,Turing test,Silence,A critical aspect of the Turing test is that a machine must give itself away as being a machine by its utterances.
1283,2,Turing test,Silence,"An interrogator must then make the ""right identification"" by correctly identifying the machine as being just that."
1284,2,Turing test,Silence,"If however a machine remains silent during a conversation, i.e. takes the fifth,  then it is not possible for an interrogator to accurately identify the machine other than by means of a calculated guess.
"
1285,2,Turing test,Silence,Even taking into account a parallel/hidden human as part of the test may not help the situation as humans can often be misidentified as being a machine.
1286,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,Mainstream AI researchers argue  that trying to pass the Turing test is merely a distraction from more fruitful research.
1287,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"Indeed, the Turing test is not an active focus of much academic or commercial effort—as Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig write: ""AI researchers have devoted little attention to passing the Turing test."
1288,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"There are several reasons.
"
1289,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"First, there are easier ways to test their programs."
1290,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"Most current research in AI-related fields is aimed at modest and specific goals, such as automated scheduling, object recognition, or logistics."
1291,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"To test the intelligence of the programs that solve these problems, AI researchers simply give them the task directly."
1292,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"Russell and Norvig suggest an analogy with the history of flight: Planes are tested by how well they fly, not by comparing them to birds."
1293,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"Aeronautical engineering texts,"" they write, ""do not define the goal of their field as 'making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'""Second, creating lifelike simulations of human beings is a difficult problem on its own that does not need to be solved to achieve the basic goals of AI research."
1294,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"Believable human characters may be interesting in a work of art, a game, or a sophisticated user interface, but they are not part of the science of creating intelligent machines, that is, machines that solve problems using intelligence.
"
1295,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,Turing wanted to provide a clear and understandable example to aid in the discussion of the philosophy of artificial intelligence.
1296,2,Turing test,Impracticality and irrelevance: the Turing test and AI research,"John McCarthy observes that the philosophy of AI is ""unlikely to have any more effect on the practice of AI research than philosophy of science generally has on the practice of science."
1297,2,Turing test,Cognitive science,"Robert French (1990) makes the case that an interrogator can distinguish human and non-human interlocutors by posing questions that reveal the low-level (i.e., unconscious) processes of human cognition, as studied by cognitive science."
1298,2,Turing test,Cognitive science,Such questions reveal the precise details of the human embodiment of thought and can unmask a computer unless it experiences the world as humans do.
1299,2,Turing test,Variations,"Numerous other versions of the Turing test, including those expounded above, have been raised through the years."
1300,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,A modification of the Turing test wherein the objective of one or more of the roles have been reversed between machines and humans is termed a reverse Turing test.
1301,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"An example is implied in the work of psychoanalyst Wilfred Bion, who was particularly fascinated by the ""storm"" that resulted from the encounter of one mind by another.  "
1302,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"In his 2000 book, among several other original points with regard to the Turing test, literary scholar Peter Swirski discussed in detail the idea of what he termed the Swirski test—essentially the reverse Turing test."
1303,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"He pointed out that it overcomes most if not all standard objections levelled at the standard version.
"
1304,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"Carrying this idea forward, R. D. Hinshelwood described the mind as a ""mind recognizing apparatus""."
1305,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,The challenge would be for the computer to be able to determine if it were interacting with a human or another computer.
1306,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"This is an extension of the original question that Turing attempted to answer but would, perhaps, offer a high enough standard to define a machine that could ""think"" in a way that we typically define as characteristically human.
"
1307,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,CAPTCHA is a form of reverse Turing test.
1308,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"Before being allowed to perform some action on a website, the user is presented with alphanumerical characters in a distorted graphic image and asked to type them out.  "
1309,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,This is intended to prevent automated systems from being used to abuse the site.
1310,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"The rationale is that software sufficiently sophisticated to read and reproduce the distorted image accurately does not exist (or is not available to the average user), so any system able to do so is likely to be a human.
"
1311,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"Software that could reverse CAPTCHA with some accuracy by analysing patterns in the generating engine started being developed soon after the creation of CAPTCHA.
"
1312,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"In 2013, researchers at Vicarious announced that they had developed a system to solve CAPTCHA challenges from Google, Yahoo!, and PayPal up to 90% of the time.
"
1313,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"In 2014, Google engineers demonstrated a system that could defeat CAPTCHA challenges with 99.8% accuracy.
"
1314,2,Turing test,Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA,"In 2015, Shuman Ghosemajumder, former click fraud czar of Google, stated that there were cybercriminal sites that would defeat CAPTCHA challenges for a fee, to enable various forms of fraud."
1315,2,Turing test,Subject matter expert Turing test,"Another variation is described as the subject matter expert Turing test, where a machine's response cannot be distinguished from an expert in a given field."
1316,2,Turing test,Subject matter expert Turing test,"This is also known as a ""Feigenbaum test"" and was proposed by Edward Feigenbaum in a 2003 paper."
1317,2,Turing test,Total Turing test,"The ""Total Turing test"" variation of the Turing test, proposed by cognitive scientist Stevan Harnad, adds two further requirements to the traditional Turing test."
1318,2,Turing test,Total Turing test,The interrogator can also test the perceptual abilities of the subject (requiring computer vision) and the subject's ability to manipulate objects (requiring robotics).
1319,2,Turing test,Electronic health records,A letter published in Communications of the ACM describes the concept of generating a synthetic patient population and proposes a variation of Turing test to assess the difference between synthetic and real patients.
1320,2,Turing test,Electronic health records,"The letter states: ""In the EHR context, though a human physician can readily distinguish between synthetically generated and real live human patients, could a machine be given the intelligence to make such a determination on its own?"" and further the letter states:"
1321,2,Turing test,Electronic health records,"""Before synthetic patient identities become a public health problem, the legitimate EHR market might benefit from applying Turing Test-like techniques to ensure greater data reliability and diagnostic value."
1322,2,Turing test,Electronic health records,Any new techniques must thus consider patients' heterogeneity and are likely to have greater complexity than the Allen eighth-grade-science-test is able to grade.
1323,2,Turing test,Minimum intelligent signal test,"The minimum intelligent signal test was proposed by Chris McKinstry as ""the maximum abstraction of the Turing test"", in which only binary responses (true/false or yes/no) are permitted, to focus only on the capacity for thought.  "
1324,2,Turing test,Minimum intelligent signal test,"It eliminates text chat problems like anthropomorphism bias, and does not require emulation of unintelligent human behaviour, allowing for systems that exceed human intelligence.  "
1325,2,Turing test,Minimum intelligent signal test,"The questions must each stand on their own, however, making it more like an IQ test than an interrogation.  "
1326,2,Turing test,Minimum intelligent signal test,It is typically used to gather statistical data against which the performance of artificial intelligence programs may be measured.
1327,2,Turing test,Hutter Prize,"The organisers of the Hutter Prize believe that compressing natural language text is a hard AI problem, equivalent to passing the Turing test.
"
1328,2,Turing test,Hutter Prize,"The data compression test has some advantages over most versions and variations of a Turing test, including:

It gives a single number that can be directly used to compare which of two machines is ""more intelligent."
1329,2,Turing test,Hutter Prize,It does not require the computer to lie to the judgeThe main disadvantages of using data compression as a test
1330,2,Turing test,Hutter Prize,"are:

"
1331,2,Turing test,Hutter Prize,"It is not possible to test humans this way.
"
1332,2,Turing test,Hutter Prize,"It is unknown what particular ""score"" on this test—if any—is equivalent to passing a human-level Turing test."
1333,2,Turing test,Other tests based on compression or Kolmogorov complexity,A related approach to Hutter's prize which appeared much earlier in the late 1990s is the inclusion of compression problems in an extended Turing test.
1334,2,Turing test,Other tests based on compression or Kolmogorov complexity,"or by tests which are completely derived from Kolmogorov complexity.
"
1335,2,Turing test,Other tests based on compression or Kolmogorov complexity,Other related tests in this line are presented by Hernandez-Orallo and Dowe.
1336,2,Turing test,Other tests based on compression or Kolmogorov complexity,"Algorithmic IQ, or AIQ for short, is an attempt to convert the theoretical Universal Intelligence Measure from Legg and Hutter (based on Solomonoff's inductive inference) into a working practical test of machine intelligence."
1337,2,Turing test,Other tests based on compression or Kolmogorov complexity,Two major advantages of some of these tests are their applicability to nonhuman intelligences and their absence of a requirement for human testers.
1338,2,Turing test,Ebert test,"The Turing test inspired the Ebert test proposed in 2011 by film critic Roger Ebert which is a test whether a computer-based synthesised voice has sufficient skill in terms of intonations, inflections, timing and so forth, to make people laugh."
1339,2,Turing test,Predictions,"Turing predicted that machines would eventually be able to pass the test; in fact, he estimated that by the year 2000, machines with around 100 MB of storage would be able to fool 30% of human judges in a five-minute test, and that people would no longer consider the phrase ""thinking machine"" contradictory."
1340,2,Turing test,Predictions,"(In practice, from 2009–2012, the Loebner Prize chatterbot contestants only managed to fool a judge once, and that was only due to the human contestant pretending to be a chatbot.)"
1341,2,Turing test,Predictions,"He further predicted that machine learning would be an important part of building powerful machines, a claim considered plausible by contemporary researchers in artificial intelligence."
1342,2,Turing test,Predictions,"In a 2008 paper submitted to 19th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Conference, Dr. Shane T. Mueller predicted a modified Turing test called a ""Cognitive Decathlon"" could be accomplished within five years."
1343,2,Turing test,Predictions,"By extrapolating an exponential growth of technology over several decades, futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that Turing test-capable computers would be manufactured in the near future."
1344,2,Turing test,Predictions,"In 1990, he set the year around 2020."
1345,2,Turing test,Predictions,"By 2005, he had revised his estimate to 2029.The Long Bet Project Bet Nr. 1 is a wager of $20,000 between Mitch Kapor (pessimist) and Ray Kurzweil (optimist) about whether a computer will pass a lengthy Turing test by the year 2029."
1346,2,Turing test,Predictions,"During the Long Now Turing Test, each of three Turing test judges will conduct online interviews of each of the four Turing test candidates (i.e., the computer and the three Turing test human foils) for two hours each for a total of eight hours of interviews."
1347,2,Turing test,Predictions,The bet specifies the conditions in some detail.
1348,2,Turing test,Turing Colloquium,"1990 marked the fortieth anniversary of the first publication of Turing's ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" paper, and, saw renewed interest in the test.  "
1349,2,Turing test,Turing Colloquium,"Two significant events occurred in that year: The first was the Turing Colloquium, which was held at the University of Sussex in April, and brought together academics and researchers from a wide variety of disciplines to discuss the Turing test in terms of its past, present, and future; the second was the formation of the annual Loebner Prize competition.
"
1350,2,Turing test,Turing Colloquium,Blay Whitby lists four major turning points in the history of the Turing test –
